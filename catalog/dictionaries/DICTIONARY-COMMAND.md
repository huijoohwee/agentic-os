<!-- Responsibility: Define canonical slash-command invocation entries and their non-executing ownership boundaries. -->

# Command Dictionary

This file defines `/` command-route content owned by agentic-os and reused by consumers. It is a dictionary for shared invocation utilities, not a new command runner, parser, provider panel, or compatibility registry.

Product document references resolve against `agentic-canvas-os/docs` unless repository-qualified.
Dictionary references resolve within this directory. Runtime and approval claims remain consumer-owned.

## Contract

| Rule | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Route owner | Existing shared `/` utilities own command detection and replacement. |
| Dictionary role | This file names command intent, required context, and proof expectations. |
| Runtime status | Spec-complete until a shared runtime owner proves execution. |
| Spend policy | Malformed input, missing approval, or missing binding fails before paid calls. |
| Deploy policy | Prod mirror and Cloudflare commands remain gated until explicit operator approval. |

## Consumer Metadata

| Consumer | Metadata read | Source fields | Runtime boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| Chat composer | Token, label, summary, group, sourcePath, keywords, prefix role. | `dictionary_entries`; Commands table Intent plus Required bindings, Semantic filters, and Completion signal. | Inserts the `/` token and preserves the editable query; unknown tokens stay raw text. |
| Skills & Commands catalog | Token, label, summary, group, sourcePath, keywords, prefix role. | Same source fields as chat composer. | Renders searchable rows and active-card insertion without copying a panel-local command list. |
| MCP | Token, prefix, intent, required bindings, semantic filters, completion signal, publish policy, source docs, full-catalog counts, and catalog digest. | Commands table plus frontmatter policy fields; deterministic digest input is token, kind, label, summary, and source path across all three dictionaries. | Metadata is reference and handoff context only; every sigil query returns the same full-catalog digest, and a dictionary row does not become an executable MCP tool without a separate shared runtime owner. |

## Commands

| Command | Intent | Required bindings | Semantic filters | Completion signal |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/soul.load` | Load durable agent identity from `SOUL.md` as prompt slot 1 without hardcoding a default identity in runtime code. | `@soul-profile`, `@identity-slot`, `@runtime-proof` | `#soul`, `#primary-identity`, `#no-hardcode`, `#vcc` | Soul source parses, scan and bound result is typed, slot 1 identity is sourced or a typed fallback is returned, and no project commands or deploy grants are introduced. |
| `/personality.overlay` | Apply a temporary session-level style or mode overlay. | `@personality-overlay`, `@operator`, `@runtime-proof` | `#personality-overlay`, `#soul`, `#approval-gate` | Overlay is session-scoped, cannot mutate `SOUL.md`, and remains subordinate to facts, roles, memory, safety, and deploy gates. |
| `/moa` | Run a one-shot Mixture of Agents pass for a hard query without switching the global model or creating a copied provider preset. | `@moa-preset`, `@reference-agents`, `@aggregator-agent`, `@cost-log`, `@operator` when paid calls are possible | `#mixture-of-agents`, `#reference-agents`, `#aggregator-agent`, `#token-economics` | Local preset resolves; no-tool capped references settle fail-soft into input-ordered typed outcomes and attempted/succeeded/failed totals; aggregator returns the only user-visible answer; tool calls use normal approval gates; cost log records reference and aggregator tokens; prior context is restored. |
| `/video-agent` | Run a source-backed, approval-gated video workflow from authored script through structured planning, media generation, persistence, read-back, and shared Canvas projection. | `@operator`, `@video-generation-demo-script`, one `@provider.*` binding, one or more of `@text`, `@image`, `@audio`, `@video`, `@cost-log`, `@runtime-proof` | one `#spec.*`, one `#thinking.type.*`, one `#token-cap.*`, `#approval-gate`, `#token-economics`, `#vcc` | The text stage returns Character, Scene, Dialogue, Visual asset, Audio, Timing, Metadata, and Prompt sheets; approved media stages persist and read back typed artifacts; Cards, Widgets, Rich Media Panels, and Timeline reuse the same identities; missing approval, credentials, entitlement, budget, persistence, read-back, or capability stops terminally. |
| `/voice.studio` | Select one bounded AI voice studio operation without creating operation-specific slash aliases. | Route-dependent `@audio`, `@text`, `@voice-profile`, `@approval-gate`, `@cost-log`, and `@runtime-proof` exactly as defined in `VOICE-STUDIO.md`. | Exactly one of `#voice-clone`, `#speech-to-text`, or `#text-to-speech`. | The exact host route resolves metadata for `clone`, `dictate`, or `create`; consent and approval remain separate, and only the `agentic-graph.voice.studio` MCP wire tool may execute. Missing rights, consent, disclosure, capability, bounds, or proof fails before audio read, adapter work, spend, or persistence. |
| `/sme-care-agent` | Produce provider-neutral SME exposure, coverage-gap, comparison, and assessment responses through the shared slash-agent owner. | `@source.frontmatter`, `@source.body`, `@local-harness`, `@cost-log`, `@runtime-proof` | `#frontmatter`, `#harness`, `#token-economics`, `#runtime-ready`, `#approval-gate` | The active Chat provider, endpoint, and model returns a source-grounded response or a focused material clarification; unknown coverage remains unknown, and missing route, evidence, approval, or capability fails closed before quote, bind, purchase, provider contact, persistence, Prod, or Cloudflare mutation. |
| `/investment-research-agent` | Produce source-grounded investment research, comparisons, and plan assessments through the shared slash-agent owner. | `@source.frontmatter`, `@source.body`, `@cost-log`, `@runtime-proof` | `#frontmatter`, `#token-economics`, `#runtime-ready`, `#approval-gate` | The active Chat provider, endpoint, and model separates evidence, assumptions, contradictions, risks, catalysts, and verification gaps or asks one material clarification; missing route or evidence fails closed without invented market facts, transactions, personalized financial advice, persistence, Prod, or Cloudflare mutation. |
| `/crawler-agent` | Run the native headless website crawl through the existing Import URL and Canvas output owners. | `@url:`, `@reference-policy`, `@runtime-proof` | `#canvas`, `#dev-only`, `#approval-gate` | The native shared runtime returns a persisted crawl report and pipe-table output or a typed URL, policy, download, storage, or capability error; paid-provider, authenticated, and external mutation actions stay blocked without approval. |
| `/image.to-threejs` | Resolve the native `image.to-threejs` skill for the selected Card or Widget source. | `@image-to-threejs`, `@local-harness`, `@runtime-proof` | `#image-to-threejs`, `#skill-system`, `#dev-only` | A PNG, JPG, JPEG, or SVG source resolves to the shared zero-cost Three.js manifest and Card, Widget, or Rich Media projection; unsupported sources return the typed fallback without provider execution. |
| `/image.to-glb` | Resolve the native procedural `image.to-glb` asset contract for the selected Card or Widget source. | `@image-to-glb`, `@local-harness`, `@runtime-proof` | `#image-to-glb`, `#skill-system`, `#dev-only` | Connected contour volumes reconstruct the observed front while hidden surfaces remain explicitly inferred; compact construction budgets, separate geometry, material, reference, and action gates, rigid named pivots and sockets, and one four-second +/-12-degree loop clip must validate before GLB plus editable external-buffer glTF export. Baked geometry, unproved skinning, or external runtime, model, dependency, and provider execution fail closed. |
| `/agentic-graph.probe-tree` | Generate bounded editable next-question branches from the selected Widget Card through the shared Probe-Tree runtime. | `@agentic-graph.probe-tree`, `@source.frontmatter`, `@runtime-proof` | `#agentic-graph.probe-tree`, `#runtime-ready`, `#token-economics` | RECOMMEND, COMPARE, ASSESS, and PLAN action topics are semantic, case-insensitive clarification requests that use the active Chat provider, endpoint, and model to return 2-4 forward-only Type 2 cards. Only a runtime-recognized selected-child terminal continuation bypasses generation; an action verb, imperative, or root alias does not. Distinct questions, selected-child decision variables, numbered semantic choices, Other, and verbatim anchors are required; bare focus fragments, query-specific hardcoding, repeated or overlapping choice sets, stale card-local routing, and zero-model fallback cards fail closed. |
| `/query` | Answer from `FACTS.md`, dictionaries, memory, and cited source docs without mutation. | `@agent`, `@source.body` | `#truth`, `#frontmatter`, `#vcc` | Response cites the owning source or returns a typed gap; no file mutation, token spend, Prod mirror change, or Cloudflare deploy occurs. |
| `/memory.seed` | Create or update a neutral memory block from source docs. | `@source.frontmatter`, `@source.body`, `@operator` | `#frontmatter`, `#no-hardcode`, `#vcc` | Parsed frontmatter and authored body memory block are present locally. |
| `/memory.write` | Add, replace, or remove a bounded memory or user-profile entry. | `@memory-store`, `@memory-entry`, `@memory-policy`, `@operator` | `#persistent-memory`, `#memory-capacity`, `#vcc` | Request names target, action, evidence, old text when replacing/removing, scan result, capacity result, and typed persistence result. |
| `/memory.compact` | Consolidate or remove stale entries when a bounded memory target is near or over capacity. | `@memory-store`, `@memory-policy`, `@runtime-proof` | `#persistent-memory`, `#memory-capacity`, `#vcc` | Compact result preserves durable facts, removes stale or duplicate entries, and returns before/after capacity without silent data loss. |
| `/memory.search` | Search scoped local memory or conversation indexes for reusable facts, decisions, and prior proof. | `@agent`, `@memory-store`, `@operator` | `#memory-search`, `#truth`, `#vcc` | Ranked results cite their source or return an empty typed result; no mutation, deploy, or paid call is implied. |
| `/session.search` | Search past conversations or session records on demand. | `@session-index`, `@operator` | `#session-search`, `#truth`, `#vcc` | Cited session matches return without automatically writing to memory or profile. |
| `/user.profile` | Add, replace, remove, or inspect explicit user-profile entries. | `@user-profile`, `@memory-entry`, `@memory-policy`, `@operator` | `#user-profile`, `#memory-capacity`, `#vcc` | Profile write is explicit, bounded, scanned, non-secret, and rejects unsupported personal inference. |
| `/skill.discover` | List lightweight skill metadata without loading full skill bodies. | `@skill-index`, `@skill-policy`, `@operator` | `#skill-system`, `#progressive-disclosure`, `#agentskills-compatible` | Index returns name, description, category, source, trust, and compatibility with zero model spend. |
| `/skill.load` | Load one selected skill source and optional on-demand resource. | `@skill-source`, `@skill-reference`, `@skill-policy` | `#skill-system`, `#progressive-disclosure`, `#skill-security` | Full skill source loads only after selection; referenced files load only when needed and shallow references validate. |
| `/skill.bundle` | Resolve a bundle that groups existing skills under one invocation. | `@skill-bundle`, `@skill-index`, `@skill-policy` | `#skill-bundle`, `#skill-system`, `#vcc` | Bundle resolves installed skills, reports skipped missing skills, and does not install or hardcode missing entries. |
| `/skill.manage` | Create, patch, edit, delete, or update supporting files for a skill. | `@skill-source`, `@skill-reference`, `@skill-policy`, `@operator` | `#skill-security`, `#skill-evolution`, `#agentskills-compatible` | Managed write is scanned, validated, review-gated when required, and returns a proposed or applied result with proof. |
| `/context.discover` | Discover project-local context files from the active working directory. | `@working-directory`, `@context-policy` | `#context-file`, `#cwd-discovery`, `#project-context` | Returns first-match startup context plus progressive subdirectory candidates with zero model spend and no file mutation. |
| `/context.load` | Load one approved context file into the behavior context. | `@context-file`, `@context-policy`, `@runtime-proof` | `#context-file`, `#project-context`, `#progressive-disclosure` | File parses as text, scans cleanly, truncates within bounds, and reports loaded or blocked state. |
| `/context.audit` | Inspect context-file precedence, loaded files, truncation, scan blocks, and stale risks. | `@working-directory`, `@context-policy`, `@runtime-proof` | `#context-file`, `#vcc`, `#no-hardcode` | Audit is read-only and reports effective context without rewriting project files or promoting CLAUDE-style files above `FACTS.md`. |
| `/reference.expand` | Expand inline context references from a message into attached context. | `@reference-policy`, `@attached-context`, `@working-directory` | `#context-reference`, `#inline-context`, `#token-economics` | References resolve, sensitive targets block, content stays bounded, and original message plus attached context are returned. |
| `/reference.audit` | Inspect reference expansion safety, size, source, and warning state. | `@reference-policy`, `@attached-context`, `@runtime-proof` | `#context-reference`, `#attached-context`, `#vcc` | Audit reports expanded references, warnings, refused expansions, truncation, and source boundaries without mutating files. |
| `/kanban.task` | Create or update one durable task row in `kanban.md`. | `@kanban-board`, `@task-row`, `@agent-profile`, `@runtime-proof` | `#kanban-board`, `#task-row`, `#multi-agent-collaboration` | Task row validates through shared multi-dimensional table/Kanban utilities and records owner, status, evidence, and next action. |
| `/kanban.handoff` | Add a readable handoff row for another named profile or worker process. | `@kanban-board`, `@handoff-row`, `@worker-process`, `@agent-profile` | `#profile-handoff`, `#worker-process`, `#vcc` | Handoff row names from, to, task id, context refs, blockers, acceptance, and resume command without in-process subagent state. |
| `/kanban.sync` | Reconcile board rows across named agent profiles without spawning fragile subagent swarms. | `@kanban-board`, `@agent-profile`, `@runtime-proof` | `#kanban-board`, `#multi-agent-collaboration`, `#no-hardcode` | Sync is row-based, conflict-aware, and preserves `kanban.md` as the durable SSOT. |
| `/tool.catalog` | Read available tool categories, routing providers, status, and unavailable states. | `@tool-gateway`, `@tool-provider`, `@tool-policy` | `#tool-gateway`, `#tool-routing`, `#cost` | Catalog returns web search, image, TTS, and browser routing states with zero model spend and no tool execution. |
| `/tool.route` | Route one tool call through the selected `agentic-graph` tool surface. | `@tool-gateway`, `@tool-provider`, `@tool-policy`, `@cost-log` | `#tool-gateway`, `#tool-routing`, `#vcc` | Tool input validates, approval gates pass, cost is logged, and fallback is typed before execution. |
| `/tool.provider.select` | Select gateway, direct, local, or unavailable provider state per tool category. | `@tool-provider`, `@tool-policy`, `@operator` | `#tool-routing`, `#approval-gate`, `#no-hardcode` | Non-secret routing preference is stored or rejected; credentials remain server-managed. |
| `/tool.gateway.audit` | Inspect routing, usage, cost, egress, approval, and deploy boundary state. | `@tool-gateway`, `@tool-provider`, `@cost-log`, `@runtime-proof` | `#tool-gateway`, `#token-economics`, `#vcc` | Audit reports per-tool status and blocked reasons without executing tool calls. |
| `/toolset.enable` | Enable a logical toolset for one platform surface. | `@toolset`, `@platform-surface`, `@tool-policy`, `@operator` | `#toolset`, `#platform-toolset`, `#approval-gate` | Toolset resolves existing tool functions, platform scope is explicit, approvals pass, and enablement state is typed. |
| `/toolset.disable` | Disable a logical toolset for one platform surface. | `@toolset`, `@platform-surface`, `@tool-policy` | `#toolset`, `#platform-toolset`, `#vcc` | Platform-scoped toolset is disabled without deleting functions, credentials, history, or unrelated provider state. |
| `/tool.search` | Search the session-scoped deferred-tool catalog. | `@deferred-tool-catalog`, `@tool-policy` | `#tool-search`, `#progressive-disclosure`, `#token-economics` | Returns ranked deferred tool metadata or a typed empty/disabled result without loading full schemas or executing tools. |
| `/tool.describe` | Load one deferred tool schema on demand. | `@deferred-tool-catalog`, `@tool-policy` | `#deferred-tool-schema`, `#tool-search`, `#vcc` | Selected tool schema resolves from the current session catalog or returns a stale, missing, or policy-blocked result. |
| `/tool.call` | Invoke a selected deferred tool through a bridge route. | `@bridge-tool`, `@tool-function`, `@tool-policy`, `@cost-log` | `#bridge-tool`, `#tool-routing`, `#approval-gate` | Call unwraps to the underlying tool identity for schema validation, approval, hooks, audit, cost, and fallback. |
| `/experience.capture` | Convert an observed run, failure, proof packet, or operator correction into a typed experience record. | `@experience`, `@source.body`, `@runtime-proof` | `#learning-loop`, `#vcc`, `#no-hardcode` | Experience record names source, lesson, applicability, cost, expiry risk, and approval state before persistence. |
| `/skill.propose` | Propose a new reusable skill from repeated experience without directly modifying runtime code. | `@experience`, `@skill-catalog`, `@operator` | `#skill-evolution`, `#harness`, `#vcc` | Proposal includes intent, schemas, bounds, cost fields, source evidence, and review status. |
| `/skill.evolve` | Optimize existing skill text through resumable bounded epochs, batches, and mini-batches. | `@skill-catalog`, `@skill-policy`, `@runtime-proof`, `@operator` | `#skill-evolution`, `#learning-loop`, `#vcc` | A source-revision-fenced `agentic-graph.skill.evolve` run applies a text-mutation learning-rate schedule and held-out gates; output is review-pending only, with no skill apply or model-weight change. |
| `/propose-skill` | Draft a candidate Agent Definition with `status: proposed` from a typed capability-gap signal; owned by the ACOS Skill_Proposer harness and distinct from `/skill.propose` by owner, typed arguments `{ gap_signal }`, and artifact type. | `@skill-registry`, `@operator` | `#skill-candidate`, `#approval-gate` | One `status: proposed` Draft_Definition exists in the draft store together with one trace entry carrying the iteration count, or a typed no-draft result returns; the Active_Registry_Snapshot stays byte-identical and promotion happens only through the separate operator-gated gate. |
| `/identity.reflect` | Update the local identity model from stable operator preferences, project boundaries, and working rules. | `@identity-model`, `@operator`, `@memory-store` | `#identity-model`, `#truth`, `#no-hardcode` | Reflection stores stable, non-secret, source-backed preferences or returns rejected inference reasons. |
| `/application.compose` | Compile or execute one version-locked agent or LLM application from interoperable component and integration interfaces. | `@application-manifest`, `@component-catalog`, `@integration-profile`, `@runtime-proof`, and `@operator` only for live or mutating execution | `#application-composition`, `#runtime-ready`, `#no-hardcode` | Plan returns one immutable digest over exact revisions, schema digests, owners, bounds, and a deterministic dependency DAG; execute delegates bounded ready steps without silent upgrade, retry, migration, or deploy. |
| `/agentic.graph.ingest` | Compile one bounded local workspace containing parser-supported code, docs, SQL, configs, and text-bearing PDFs into one digest-fenced explained-edge graph snapshot. | `@working-directory`, `@agentic-graph`, `@operator`, `@runtime-proof` | `#agentic-graph`, `#mcp`, `#runtime-ready` | `agentic-graph.agent_graph.ingest` returns opaque `graphId`, exact `snapshotDigest`, completeness, counts, and a bounded read-only projection; Agentic Canvas OS supplies invocation policy and typed forwarding only. |
| `/agentic.graph.parser.generate` | Compile one source-backed inert parser-registry specification into a deterministic canonical v2 registry of fixed adapters or bounded declarative grammar data. | exactly `@parser-specification` and `@runtime-proof` | exactly `#agentic-graph`, `#parser-generation`, and `#mcp` | `agentic-graph.agent_graph.parser_generate` validates bounded descriptors and finite grammar data, then returns one canonical registry with its exact digest; Agentic Canvas OS adds no parser runtime, generated code, adapter, artifact store, model, network path, or implicit ingest. |
| `/agentic.graph.query` | Query one exact local knowledge-graph snapshot with bounded deterministic lexical search, path, neighborhood, impact, or summary operations. | `@agentic-graph`, `@runtime-proof` | `#agentic-graph`, `#mcp`, `#vcc` | `agentic-graph.agent_graph.query` requires opaque `graphId`, exact `expectedSnapshotDigest`, and `mode`, then returns ordered evidence from that exact snapshot; stale identity and vector lookup fail closed. |
| `/agentic.graph.explain` | Explain one exact relationship from one digest-bound local knowledge-graph snapshot. | `@agentic-graph`, `@runtime-proof` | `#agentic-graph`, `#mcp`, `#vcc` | `agentic-graph.agent_graph.explain_edge` requires opaque `graphId`, exact `expectedSnapshotDigest`, and `edgeId`, then returns stored endpoints, relationship kind, deterministic explanation, source evidence, parser identity, and extraction rule without reparsing or inference. |

| `/ingest-url` | Import one operator-provided URL through the existing workspace URL intake, Source Files, and Canvas projection owners. | exactly one `@url:` value and `@reference-policy` | exactly `#canvas` | Canonical invocation `/ingest-url @url:https://example.com @reference-policy #canvas`; `agentic-graph.agentic_canvas_os.docs.invoke` resolves source-backed metadata only, while guarded browser WebMCP tool `agentic-graph.control_local_import_url` returns one typed imported, blocked, or failed result without a second importer, embedded URL, credential exposure, Prod mutation, or Cloudflare deployment. |
| `/computing-flow` | Generate or validate a source-backed Agentic OS computing-flow DAG. | `@operator`, `@source.frontmatter`, `@local-harness`, `@runtime-proof` | `#computing-flow`, `#frontmatter`, `#harness`, `#vcc` | `agentic-os-computing-flow/v1` frontmatter validates and routes through Agentic OS validation before Canvas projection. |
| Bare `/moa` | Return usage for the MoA route. | `@agent` | `#mixture-of-agents` | Usage response explains required query or scoped selection; it does not switch model, mutate state, or call a provider. |

## Command Shape

```yaml
command:
  token: "/runtime-ready.check"
  role: "command route"
  input:
    source_ref: "@source.frontmatter"
    semantic_filters: ["#harness", "#vcc"]
  output:
    status: "runtime-ready | spec-complete | gated | blocked"
    proof_ref: "@runtime-proof"
  bounds:
    max_iterations: 1
    fail_before_spend: true
```

## Resolution Rules

| Situation | Resolution |
|---|---|
| Command is known and bindings are present | Route through the existing shared utility or runtime owner. |
| Command is known but binding is missing | Return a structured missing-binding response. |
| `/soul.load` finds missing, empty, unsafe, or unreadable source | Return typed fallback identity state; do not silently embed a hardcoded default. |
| `/personality.overlay` conflicts with facts, safety, or deploy gates | Reject the overlay before prompt assembly. |
| `/memory.write` or `/user.profile` exceeds capacity | Return typed capacity error and require `/memory.compact`, replace, or remove before retry. |
| `/session.search` finds relevant history | Return cited search results; require explicit `/memory.write` or `/user.profile` before persistence. |
| `/skill.load` references a supporting file | Load only the named shallow file under the selected skill root; reject deep or unsafe references. |
| `/skill.manage` would mutate a skill under approval policy | Stage or return review-required before writing; never auto-commit protected skill changes. |
| `/context.discover` finds several project context types | Apply one local precedence rule and report skipped matches; do not merge duplicate instruction layers. |
| `/context.load` finds prompt injection, secrets, invisible controls, or exfiltration content | Block before inclusion and return a typed blocked-context result. |
| `/context.audit` finds stale or conflicting project context | Report the conflict and fix the source file or shared owner; do not add a downstream remap. |
| `/reference.expand` targets sensitive, binary, missing, outside-workspace, or over-hard-limit content | Append typed warning or refuse expansion before injecting content. |
| `/reference.expand` runs on a platform that does not support inline expansion | Preserve the raw message and report unsupported-platform without rewriting the text. |
| `/kanban.task` or `/kanban.handoff` lacks a row id, owner profile, status, or acceptance field | Reject before write; do not create partial board rows. |
| `/agent.team` lacks exact team, agent-definition, workflow, branch, review-policy, bound, plan-digest, idempotency, or state-version fences | Reject before model, tool, state, or spend mutation; do not infer a role, route, owner, review decision, retry, or Agent Swarm fallback. |
| `/agent.swarm` receives caller-authored roles, specialists, tasks, branches, or workflow topology, or cannot resolve the exact base-agent revision | Reject before planning or spend; do not infer a handcrafted workflow or stale agent. |
| `/agent.toolkit` receives a missing, malformed, changed, or application-denied revision digest, raw telemetry content, undeclared metric direction, caller-owned signal, or apply request | Reject before observation, evaluator spend, persistence, or mutation; remote metadata that passes schema remains untrusted and cannot enter comparison evidence. |
| `/kanban.sync` sees conflicting writes to the same row | Preserve both evidence fields and require explicit resolution; do not overwrite another profile's handoff. |
| `/tool.route` targets a paid, mutating, browser-auth, egress, or generated-media tool | Require `@operator` approval and fail closed without approval. |
| `/tool.provider.select` includes credentials or browser secrets | Reject and require server-managed secret setup; do not write secrets into docs or client state. |
| `/toolset.enable` would expose paid, mutating, browser-auth, egress, filesystem, terminal, or generated-media tools | Require `@operator` approval and scoped `@platform-surface`; fail closed without both. |
| `/tool.search` is enabled without a current deferred catalog | Return no-deferred-catalog; do not scan global tool registries. |
| `/tool.describe` targets a tool outside the session catalog | Return unavailable-for-session before schema disclosure. |
| `/tool.call` lacks described schema or real tool policy | Block before execution; never treat the bridge as approval. |
| `/moa` references an MoA preset as aggregator | Reject with a typed recursion error before token spend. |
| `/superagent.run` lacks sandbox scope, message gateway, checkpoint policy, or stop condition | Reject before execution; do not start an open-ended agent loop. |
| `/adlc.observe` lacks an exact immutable `adlc-ledger-receipt/v1`, expected revision, or expected ledger digest, or the source bytes drift, or its exact evaluator is absent | Return a typed read-only block before projection (`adlc_evaluator_unavailable` is nonretryable); do not infer a receipt, repair a ledger, translate `delivery_ready` into `verified`, infer `deployed`, call a model or network, or create a second graph store or renderer. |
| `/application.compose` receives missing bindings, mutable or inexact references, digest drift, an incompatible capability or schema, a cyclic or ambiguous DAG, or executable, connection, or secret material | Reject before owner execution or spend; do not choose a fallback, upgrade, install, retry, migrate, connect, or deploy. |
| `/agentic.graph.parser.generate` receives a missing, mutable, executable, ambiguous, oversized, or unsupported parser specification | Reject before registry compilation or publication; do not infer source matchers, download an adapter, execute caller code, fall back to a model or remote service, or start ingestion. |
| `/repository.pack` receives a non-Git root, unsafe path, symlink escape, changed source, sensitive content, unknown field, or exceeded bound | Block before artifact publication, remove staging residue, and return a source-byte-free typed error; do not fall back to a remote service, external binary, model, or alternate alias. |
| An ECS command receives a missing, expired, or disposed `@ecs-session` | Return a typed session error without reconstructing hidden state or persisting caller-supplied decisions. |
| Command requires paid, mutating, payment, Prod, or Cloudflare action | Require `@operator` approval and fail closed without approval. |
| Command conflicts with source frontmatter | Fix the source or shared owner; do not add a downstream alias. |
| Command is unknown | Reject with a typed unsupported-command result and suggest nearest dictionary entries. |

## VCCs

| VCC | Check |
|---|---|
| Dictionary parses | Frontmatter parses as YAML and `dictionary_entries` lists slash-prefixed tokens. |
| No duplicate runtime | No body section claims a new parser, command server, or provider panel. |
| Fail-closed command path | Every command row names required bindings and a measurable completion signal. |
| Deploy boundary preserved | `/deploy.guard` remains Dev-only unless explicit operator approval is present. |
| ADLC observation stays read-only | `/adlc.observe #adlc-observability @implementation-run @canvas @runtime-proof` resolves exactly one local tool and requires an immutable ledger receipt before deterministic existing-Canvas projection. |
