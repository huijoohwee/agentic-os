<!-- Responsibility: Define canonical semantic invocation entries and their source-backed proof boundaries. -->

# Semantic Dictionary

This file defines `#` semantic-route content owned by agentic-os and reused by consumers. Tags classify intent, risk, and proof requirements. They do not create duplicate stores, stale aliases, or model prompts by themselves.

Product document references resolve against `agentic-canvas-os/docs` unless repository-qualified.
Dictionary references resolve within this directory. Runtime and approval claims remain consumer-owned.

## Contract

| Rule | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Route owner | Existing shared `#` utilities own tag detection and routing. |
| Dictionary role | This file names semantic meaning, match criteria, and required proof. |
| Runtime status | Spec-complete until a source-backed runtime check proves the claim. |
| Cost policy | Semantic filtering is zero-spend unless an approved harness explicitly runs. |
| Drift policy | Conflicting tag usage is neutralized at the source document or shared owner. |

## Consumer Metadata

| Consumer | Metadata read | Source fields | Runtime boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| Chat composer | Token, label, summary, group, sourcePath, keywords, prefix role. | `dictionary_entries`; Tags table Meaning, Match when, and Required proof. | Inserts the `#` token and preserves the editable query; unknown tags stay raw text. |
| Skills & Commands catalog | Token, label, summary, group, sourcePath, keywords, prefix role. | Same source fields as chat composer. | Renders searchable rows and active-card insertion without copying a panel-local semantic list. |
| MCP | Token, prefix, meaning, match criteria, required proof, publish policy, source docs, full-catalog counts, and catalog digest. | Tags table plus frontmatter policy fields; deterministic digest input is token, kind, label, summary, and source path across all three dictionaries. | Metadata is reference and filter context only; every sigil query returns the same full-catalog digest, and a semantic tag does not authorize tool execution, spend, mutation, or deploy. |

## Tags

| Tag | Meaning | Match when | Required proof |
|---|---|---|---|
| `#truth` | Source-backed fact stable enough for shared agent reuse. | A claim affects routing, precedence, deployment gates, or agent behavior. | Owning source is `FACTS.md`, a `DICTIONARY-*` file, or frontmatter/body source; stale or inferred claims are rejected. |
| `#soul` | Durable agent identity, voice, and communication defaults. | A claim defines who the agent is, how it speaks, or what it avoids stylistically. | `SOUL.md` parses, stays broad and stable, and excludes project operations, file paths, commands, ports, credentials, and deploy approvals. |
| `#primary-identity` | Prompt slot 1 identity replacement. | A runtime assembles a system prompt identity block. | Identity resolves from `@soul-profile` into `@identity-slot`, or returns a typed fallback instead of silent hardcode. |
| `#personality-overlay` | Temporary session-level style or mode overlay. | A session needs a reversible tone or teaching/review mode change. | Overlay is session-scoped, cannot mutate `SOUL.md`, and stays subordinate to facts, safety, approval, and deploy gates. |
| `#mixture-of-agents` | Bounded multi-agent deliberation where references advise and one aggregator acts. | A hard query needs multiple perspectives before a single response or tool plan. | Local preset, reference list, aggregator, token caps, no-recursion rule, cost log, and no-copy boundary are present. |
| `#reference-agents` | Advisory reference calls inside a Mixture of Agents run. | A model or agent produces private analysis for aggregation, not a user-visible final answer. | Calls are no-tool, bounded by max tokens and timeout, scoped to trimmed context, and all-settled fail-soft as input-ordered advisory successes or sanitized typed failures with aggregate counts. |
| `#aggregator-agent` | Acting agent that produces the final MoA response. | One model or agent consumes advisory context and may call tools through the normal harness. | Aggregator owns visible response, tool schemas, approval gates, transcript persistence, and follow-up iterations. |
| `#frontmatter` | YAML frontmatter identity, routing, render flags, and gates. | A document or source needs parse-first SSOT behavior. | Frontmatter parse succeeds without repair-only fallback. |
| `#harness` | Typed AI or tool execution contract. | A capability invokes a model, tool, workflow, or bounded agent. | Input schema, output schema, fallback, cost log, and bounds are present. |
| `#token-economics` | Prompt, completion, cache, latency, and spend performance. | A workflow can spend tokens or repeat calls. | Cost fields include model, token counts, cache hits, and estimated cost. |
| `#spec.low` | Cost-bounded generation specification. | A video-agent request prefers the minimum viable generation quality and breadth. | The invocation resolves exactly one specification, reports `low`, and keeps provider spend and artifact scope bounded. |
| `#spec.medium` | Balanced generation specification. | A video-agent request needs more fidelity or coverage than the low profile. | The invocation resolves exactly one specification, reports `medium`, and applies the provider-neutral balanced profile. |
| `#spec.high` | Highest configured generation specification. | An approved video-agent request prioritizes maximum configured fidelity. | The invocation resolves exactly one specification, reports `high`, and blocks before spend when capability or budget cannot satisfy it. |
| `#thinking.type.enabled` | Always enable supported model reasoning for this invocation. | A model-bearing stage requires deliberate reasoning before its visible result. | The provider request carries `thinking.type: enabled`; unsupported models or endpoints fail closed instead of silently disabling it. |
| `#thinking.type.disabled` | Disable model reasoning for this invocation. | A direct-answer stage explicitly prefers latency and visible-output budget over reasoning. | The provider request carries `thinking.type: disabled` and does not send incompatible non-minimal reasoning effort. |
| `#thinking.type.auto` | Let a supported model decide whether reasoning is needed. | The operator prefers adaptive depth rather than always-on or always-off reasoning. | The provider request carries `thinking.type: auto`; unsupported models or endpoints return a typed capability gap. |
| `#token-cap.low` | Low video-agent reasoning and total completion budget profile. | An invocation prioritizes cost and latency. | Runtime maps the profile to `reasoning_effort: low` and `max_completion_tokens: 4096`, or blocks when the selected model supports less. |
| `#token-cap.medium` | Balanced video-agent reasoning and total completion budget profile; default for the source-backed demo preset. | An invocation needs the complete structured package at a bounded default budget. | Runtime maps the profile to `reasoning_effort: medium` and `max_completion_tokens: 16384`, or blocks when the selected model supports less. |
| `#token-cap.high` | High video-agent reasoning and total completion budget profile. | An explicitly approved invocation needs maximum configured planning depth or output breadth. | Runtime maps the profile to `reasoning_effort: high` and `max_completion_tokens: 32768`, or blocks when entitlement, model capability, or budget is insufficient. |
| `#tco` | Total cost of ownership and deployment-model comparison. | A dependency, provider, cloud service, or new runtime path is proposed. | FOSS or existing-owner alternative and 12-month cost assumption are named. |
| `#vcc` | Verifiable completion conditions. | A claim needs measurable done criteria. | Given-When-Then and VCC text name observable output and a bounded check. |
| `#no-hardcode` | Hardcoded URLs, credentials, provider IDs, generated assets, or fixtures. | A source risks stale or operator-specific data. | Embedded artifact is removed or replaced with neutral source-owned reference. |
| `#foss` | Open-source, local, zero-egress, or vendor-neutral alternative. | A dependency or hosted service is under consideration. | Alternative path is named before paid or proprietary adoption. |
| `#ttv` | Time to value for min-viable-max-value scope. | Scope needs prioritization or a feature could become broad. | Must/Should/Could/Won't or equivalent ROI cut is present. |
| `#runtime-ready` | Claim can be proven from surfaced runtime output. | A spec-complete artifact is being promoted. | Parse, route, schema, cost, bound, approval, and focused validation proof are surfaced. |
| `#agentic-ecs` | Native entity-component-system hydration, tick, decision, and projection behavior owned by agentic-graph. | One of the three ECS MCP commands operates on a Agentic OS-backed session. | Session identity, deterministic component/entity state, transactional tick outcome, decision provenance, cost logs, and the Dev-only execution boundary are explicit. |
| `#dev-only` | Local development boundary. | Work must stop before Prod mirror or Cloudflare. | Status shows no Prod mirror mutation and no Cloudflare deploy command. |
| `#mcp` | MCP discovery, gateway federation, or tool contract. | A capability is exposed to local, Pages, browser, or control-plane agents. | Tool IDs dedupe and discovery reports zero model spend. |
| `#webmcp` | Browser-local W3C Model Context surface scope for in-page tool registration and inspection. | A request routes to a browser-local `agentic-graph.inspect_local_*` or `agentic-graph.control_local_*` tool instead of a local, Pages, or control-plane MCP owner. | The recorded API revision in `@webmcp-surface` resolves; an absent registration API fails visibly as an unavailable surface before any tool is advertised, and the token grants no model, network, camera, persistence, Prod, or Cloudflare authority. |
| `#repository-packing` | Deterministic, bounded conversion of one exact local Git worktree into one AI-friendly content-addressed Markdown artifact. | `/repository.pack #repository-packing @repository-root @runtime-proof` requests the local stdio MCP owner. | Canonical Git discovery, typed omissions, source and artifact digests, path containment, atomic publication, independence proof, and zero network, model, token, cost, Prod, and Cloudflare activity are explicit. |
| `#git-remote` | Browser Git object/ref operations with remote transport isolated behind a Dev Worker relay. | `/git.run` inspects, commits, clones, fetches, or pushes a configured remote. | Exact object hashing, atomic authority rejection, active persistence, bounded transport, expected-old ref checks, typed conflicts, and Worker-only credentials are proven. |
| `#git-collaboration` | Git collaboration rules. | A task enters any git stage from session start through cleanup. | `../node_modules/agentic-os/docs/adlc-guidelines.md` resolves and the focused checker reports registration parity. |
| `#multi-provider-file-sync` | Bidirectional file or directory transfer through a provider-neutral browser contract. | `/file.sync` pulls or pushes a configured provider prefix. | Provider capability, pagination, hash semantics, per-file outcomes, both-sides-changed conflicts, size/time bounds, offline FIFO, and secret-free browser payloads are proven. |
| `#canvas` | Source-backed Canvas projection. | Runtime state must render as graph, table, Agentic OS, or Storyboard surface. | Existing Canvas owners render without dashboard-only storage. |
| `#canvas-node` | Canvas graph node selection, creation, opening, linking, or deletion intent. | A command acts on a node, creates a node, or needs selected-node context. | Node id, type, label, graph point, mutation owner, and selection state are explicit. |
| `#canvas-edge` | Canvas graph edge selection, creation, endpoint update, or provenance intent. | A command creates, opens, rewires, or serializes an edge. | Source, target, label, selected edge id, and duplicate-edge handling are explicit. |
| `#canvas-media` | Media metadata, rich media panel, media-node projection, or bounded immersive-media presentation on the shared Canvas. | A command updates node media properties, creates media-backed graph state, or invokes `/media.immersive @canvas #canvas-media`. | Media kind, validated URL/reference when supplied, view bounds, interaction state, projection layers, annotations, overlays, capture result, and shared media and renderer owners are explicit. |
| `#canvas-layout` | Schema-owned Canvas layout force tuning, preset, or reset intent. | A command changes anti-line, post-fit, or layout-force behavior. | Layout values live in graph schema state and focused proof reports the applied or reset values. |
| `#canvas-view` | Semantic Canvas View Mode row-value selection across renderer, layout, document, surface, animation, and display controls. | `/canvas.view.set @canvas-view` applies one value exposed by the shared Canvas View menu or browser-local MCP contract. | The selected value resolves to one canonical option id, remains visible and hit-testable on its semantic row affordance, and delegates to the existing toolbar action owner without a duplicate registry or silent fallback. |
| `#workspace-launch` | Semantic Launch toolbar row selection across navigation, workspace panels, imports, authored files, save, export, and status actions. | `/workspace.launch @canvas` invokes one value exposed by the shared Launch menu or browser-local MCP contract. | Every value is visible and hit-testable, resolves to one canonical option id, delegates to its existing owner, and reports applied, requested-user-input, or a visible failure without duplicate menu or workspace state. |
| `#workspace-artifact-lifecycle` | Provider-neutral create, inspect, update, import, export, trash, and restore semantics for bounded local files and folders. | `/workspace.artifact.manage` selects one declared operation, workspace entry, and policy. | Plan/apply digest parity, configured-root containment, symlink rejection, collision policy, size and entry bounds, atomic write/read-back, typed recovery, idempotency, and explicit operator authority are proven; unsupported recursive transfer, purge, network, Prod, and Cloudflare stay blocked. |
| `#toolbar-action` | Semantic Main Toolbar action across settings, history, help, node and edge creation, workflow run/reset, undo/redo, search, chat, theme, and app install. | `/toolbar.invoke @canvas` invokes one canonical action id exposed by the semantic button or browser-local MCP contract. | Every supported button is itself visible and hit-testable, carries the canonical invocation metadata, delegates to its existing action owner, and returns applied or blocked without generic decoration, hidden affordances, duplicate state, or silent failure. |
| `#canvas-selection` | Current Canvas node or edge selection used as the active invocation subject. | A command needs the active node/edge rather than a global panel-local target. | Selection source, selected id, and missing-selection behavior are typed before mutation or chat append. |
| `#canvas-viewport` | Viewport readout, visible bounds, center point, or active camera state. | A command inspects or changes visible canvas position, dimensions, or center. | Readout is derived from shared viewport utilities and reports missing viewport state as typed empty output. |
| `#camera` | Shared Camera source selection, framing, and motion runtime across 2D, 3D, and XR surface modes. | A command inspects, selects via `/camera.select`, frames, animates, plays, or scrubs the Camera. | One application runtime owns Camera state; FloatingPanel projects controls and BottomPanel Timeline owns motion transport. |
| `#camera-shot` | Camera angle, level, shot size, and focal-length framing parameters. | `/camera.frame` changes composition around the selected subject. | Parameters validate against shared Camera framing options and return the exact applied pose. |
| `#camera-motion` | Camera rig, numbered camera marks, playhead, duration, and playback state. | `/camera.animate`, `/camera.play`, or `/camera.scrub` controls choreography. | Rig and time values update one canonical XR camera track and BottomPanel Timeline transport with bounded runtime proof. |
| `#character-motion` | Native procedural performance applied to an XR cast track, such as fight, dance, sit, drink, jump, playing cards, or squirt-gun action. | `/animation.control` applies or clears a typed character-motion preset for the selected actor. | Preset id, compatible subject category, deterministic pose sampling, timing, persistence, and package export are proven through the shared XR runtime without external animation assets. |
| `#pose` | Human-pose intent for a bounded Motion Control session on the shared Canvas. | `/motion.control @canvas #pose` requests one browser-local Motion Control inspection or control operation. | Dev-only WebMCP tools `agentic-graph.inspect_local_motion_control` and `agentic-graph.control_local_motion_control` return typed state or applied or blocked proof; the token itself grants no camera access, inference, renderer, persistence, Prod, or Cloudflare authority. |
| `#gameplay` | Deterministic Game Mode scope for scored Agentic ECS decisions, local collision and hitscan, player controls, HUD errors, and validated Decision persistence. | `/game.mode @canvas #gameplay` requests one browser-local Game Mode inspection or control operation. | Dev-only WebMCP tools `agentic-graph.inspect_local_game_mode` and `agentic-graph.control_local_game_mode` reuse agentic-graph's existing Canvas, XR Mode, Motion Control, ECS, and workspace owners; this token adds no model, network, renderer, camera, persistence, Prod, or Cloudflare authority. |
| `#game-portability` | Capability-detected Agentic Game OS portability across browser Safari, iOS, iPadOS, visionOS Safari, and native SwiftUI and RealityKit projections. | `/game.portability #game-portability @portability-layer` selects the source-backed portability contract. | One exact Invocation SSOT tuple resolves with agentic-graph as shared capability and backend owner and GameXR as frontend-only projection owner; the semantic token executes no runtime and grants no persistence, provider, model, credential, Prod, Cloudflare, or deploy authority. |
| `#flight` | Deterministic Flight Sim scope for authored XR terrain, lifecycle, normalized controls, telemetry, training state, and validated Decision persistence. | `/flight.sim @canvas #flight` requests one browser-local Flight Sim inspection or control operation. | Dev-only WebMCP tools `agentic-graph.inspect_local_flight_sim` and `agentic-graph.control_local_flight_sim` reuse agentic-graph's existing Canvas, XR Mode, ECS, input, and workspace owners; this token adds no model, network, renderer, camera, persistence, Prod, or Cloudflare authority. |
| `#action-path` | Native meter-based trajectory applied to an XR cast track, such as plane landing, helicopter orbit, car chase, or collapsing debris. | `/animation.control` applies or clears a typed action-path preset for the selected actor. | Bounded marks, altitude, facing, timing, deterministic sampling, persistence, and package export are proven through the shared XR runtime without a second path or timeline owner. |
| `#transform` | Scene-authored XR subject asset, position, yaw rotation, scale, or color transform. | `/xr.transform` targets exactly one dynamic subject binding. | Browser-local WebMCP tool `agentic-graph.control_local_xr_scene` validates bounded transform fields and persists through one shared scene owner; this semantic token does not execute or duplicate that runtime. |
| `#world` | Canonical XR physics-world transport and configuration scope. | `/xr.physics @canvas #world` requests `play`, `pause`, `stop`, `reset`, `step`, or `configure`. | Browser-local WebMCP tool `agentic-graph.control_local_xr_scene` owns fixed-step world state and returns applied or blocked proof; the dictionary adds no physics owner. |
| `#body` | Physics-body component scope for one scene-authored XR subject. | `/xr.physics @canvas #body` requests `attach`, `configure`, or `detach` with a bounded non-empty subject id. | Browser-local WebMCP tool `agentic-graph.control_local_xr_scene` owns component validation and persistence; Agentic ECS remains a separate composition lane and does not own the rendered body. |
| `#impulse` | Bounded impulse-vector scope for one dynamic XR subject. | `/xr.physics @canvas #impulse` requests `impulse` with a bounded non-empty subject id and `x,y,z` vector. | Browser-local WebMCP tool `agentic-graph.control_local_xr_scene` applies the vector only to an eligible live body and reports typed failure otherwise. |
| `#controller` | Native XR controller development and lifecycle scope. | `/xr.physics @canvas #controller` requests `develop-run`, `pause`, `resume`, `reset`, `exit`, or `select`. | Browser-local WebMCP tool `agentic-graph.control_local_xr_scene` owns the controller mode and lifecycle; the token grants no external controller, device, or deployment authority. |
| `#reticle` | Current immersive AR hit-test placement target for the canonical XR scene. | `/xr.present @scene #reticle` requests one placement commit. | Browser-local WebMCP tool `agentic-graph.control_local_xr_scene` commits only a current valid reticle and returns a typed block otherwise; the token does not grant sensor or camera access. |
| `#canvas-transform` | Zoom scale and screen-space translation for the active canvas viewport. | A command inspects, applies, clamps, or audits the zoom transform. | Transform values resolve through shared zoom/projection owners, not a floating-panel recalculation. |
| `#canvas-zoom` | Zoom mode, zoom speed, fit-to-screen, or zoom-to-selection behavior. | A request changes or audits zoom modes, bounds, duration, or selection fitting. | Mode, duration, and scale bounds are read from existing store/schema owners and fail closed on unsupported renderer state. |
| `#canvas-wheel` | Wheel or trackpad gesture routing, speed, modifier boost, or overlay proxy behavior. | A request changes or audits wheel input, trackpad input, or overlay wheel routing. | Gesture policy names the current shared owner and preserves overlay guard behavior. |
| `#canvas-interaction` | Pointer mode, selection mode, view lock, run mode, interaction speed, drag behavior, or Flow input behavior. | A command changes user-input behavior rather than graph source content, including `/canvas.interaction.tune @canvas option=<id>`. | Interaction toolbar row values remain semantic, visible, and hit-testable; the browser-local MCP bridge delegates to existing toolbar/store owners, and unsupported changes return typed blocked state without duplicate control state. |
| `#canvas-flow` | Flow renderer wheel, selection, and overlay interaction behavior inside canvas surfaces. | A request affects Flow canvas input, selection-on-drag, or overlay wheel proxy state. | Flow behavior stays renderer-owned and does not create duplicate floating-panel state. |
| `#canvas-physics` | Schema-owned 2D physics force, velocity, overlap, label, and drag tuning. | A command changes charge, collision, speed, overlap, label nudge, drag charge, or drag distance. | Values clamp through graph schema physics tuning and report applied/reset proof. |
| `#canvas-centroid` | Centroid or center target for selected items, all items, or visible viewport fitting. | A request centers selection, all items, or computes the active centroid target. | Target scope, selection count, and fallback behavior are explicit before arrange dispatch. |
| `#canvas-even-spread` | Even distribution of selected canvas items along a requested axis. | A request distributes selected nodes horizontally or vertically. | At least three selected nodes and a valid axis are required before mutation. |
| `#canvas-performance` | Canvas render diagnostics, state update rate, layout timing, and performance overlay proof. | A request inspects render churn, layout timing, diagnostic overlay state, or perf automation output. | Diagnostic data comes from shared performance owners and remains read-only unless an approved runtime toggles a diagnostic overlay. |
| `#cost` | Cost log and budget accounting. | A path needs budget observability but not full TCO analysis. | Cost log validates and model-free views report exact zero. |
| `#approval-gate` | Human gate for paid, mutating, payment, browser-auth, or deploy action. | A run can spend, mutate, authenticate, pay, or deploy. | Missing approval blocks before spend or mutation. |
| `#no-legacy` | Remove stale aliases, remaps, duplicate owners, and compatibility paths. | A source contains old names, shims, or downstream patches. | Stale path is removed at source; no new alias is added. |
| `#computing-flow` | Agentic OS/frontmatter DAG execution contract. | A document or chat request generates, validates, or runs a computing-flow. | `agentic-os-computing-flow/v1` frontmatter owns topology, typed inputs, explicit handles, bounded execution, and validation proof. |
| `#learning-loop` | Closed learning cycle from experience capture to reviewed persistence. | A workflow turns run evidence, failures, or operator corrections into reusable memory or skill proposals. | Source evidence, applicability, expiry risk, bounds, approval state, and no-copy statement are present. |
| `#persistent-memory` | Bounded curated memory that persists across sessions. | An entry records environment facts, conventions, lessons, profile preferences, or reusable project context. | Target is explicit, entry is scanned, capacity is checked, duplicate/stale handling is defined, and write result is typed. |
| `#user-profile` | Explicit operator preferences, communication style, and expectations. | A claim belongs to the operator profile rather than agent notes or project rules. | Operator evidence or approval is present; unsupported personal inference, secrets, and sensitive profiling are rejected. |
| `#frozen-snapshot` | Session-start memory/profile prompt snapshot. | A runtime injects memory or profile into prompt context. | Snapshot is captured once at session start; mid-session writes persist but do not mutate the active prompt. |
| `#memory-capacity` | Character/token bound for memory and profile targets. | A write could overflow or a target approaches its limit. | Overflow returns typed error; compaction, replacement, or removal is required before retry. |
| `#session-search` | On-demand search over prior conversations or session records. | A task needs specifics from past conversations that are not in active memory. | Results cite sessions and remain read-only unless explicitly captured. |
| `#skill-system` | On-demand procedural knowledge loaded only when useful. | A task should use a reusable skill, skill variant, or skill source. | Metadata discovery, selected source load, shallow resource loading, and no-copy policy are present. |
| `#instruction-audit` | Structural context discipline for durable guidance and skill catalogs. | Instruction surfaces are added, expanded, consolidated, or promoted. | Required intent, budgets, duplication, progressive disclosure, owner boundaries, zero model cost, and deploy state are reported. |
| `#instruction-quality` | Behavioral screening of final answers produced under a named instruction revision. | Structural instruction changes need observable task-quality evidence. | A complete provenance-bound candidate packet passes every registered case and receives human review without model-quality overclaims. |
| `#image-to-threejs` | Native image-source conversion into a typed Three.js render projection. | A selected Card or Widget binds one PNG, JPG, JPEG, or SVG source to `image.to-threejs`. | The shared `imageToThreeJs` contract validates the source, reports zero model cost, and projects one canonical `threejs` render mode or a typed fallback. |
| `#image-to-glb` | Native image-source conversion into a procedural GLB asset contract. | A selected Card or Widget binds one PNG, JPG, JPEG, or SVG source to `image.to-glb`. | Procedural connected contour volumes distinguish the observed front from inferred hidden surfaces; compact budgets and separate geometry, material, reference, and action gates admit only rigid named pivots and sockets with one validated four-second +/-12-degree loop clip, then export GLB and editable external-buffer glTF. Baked geometry, unproved skinning, or external runtime, model, dependency, and provider execution fail closed. |
| `#agentic-graph.probe-tree` | Bounded Probe-Tree Type 2 generation and continuation from a Widget Card. | A selected or answered child invokes `/agentic-graph.probe-tree` with its authored graph identity, canonical numbered multi-select or Other Output, and bounded ancestor lineage. | Action topics use semantic and case-insensitive classification and produce 2-4 context-relevant clarification cards; only a runtime-recognized selected-child terminal continuation bypasses generation. Each card requires a distinct decision variable, semantic choices plus Other, and verbatim child-or-lineage anchors; bare focus fragments, stock or recalled content, mechanical action-verb terminal inference, and root-alias ownership fail validation, branches cascade forward without backtracking, pinned coordinates remain authoritative, generation does not reload the page, and depth or approval limits stop visibly before spend. |
| `#progressive-disclosure` | Token-minimizing staged loading. | A large skill or resource tree could waste prompt context. | Metadata loads first; full skill source and resources load only after explicit selection. |
| `#skill-bundle` | Grouped skill invocation. | A recurring task needs several existing skills together. | Bundle resolves existing skills, reports missing skills, and does not install or duplicate registry entries. |
| `#agentskills-compatible` | Open-standard skill file compatibility. | A skill source is authored, inspected, imported, or validated. | Standard frontmatter, concise activation description, Markdown body, optional resources, and validation are present. |
| `#skill-security` | Skill trust, scan, compatibility, and write approval. | A skill is loaded from an external source or modified by an agent. | Unsafe content, secrets, incompatible requirements, copied external artifacts, and unreviewed writes fail closed. |
| `#context-file` | Project-local instruction file that shapes behavior. | A working directory contains AGENTS-style, CLAUDE-style, or editor-rule context. | Discovery, precedence, scan, truncation, and load state are explicit and source-backed. |
| `#project-context` | Behavioral context scoped to a project or subdirectory. | Instructions apply because the agent is operating under a working directory or touched path. | `FACTS.md` remains stronger for this docs folder; context files cannot authorize deploy or override system/operator instructions. |
| `#cwd-discovery` | Working-directory and ancestor/subdirectory context discovery. | Startup or tool-path use may reveal relevant context files. | Each directory is checked at most once per session and missing files produce typed empty results. |
| `#context-reference` | Inline `@` message reference that requests bounded content expansion. | A message contains approved reference forms such as file, folder, diff, staged, git, or URL references. | Reference class, source, scan, size, warning, platform support, and no-copy boundary are explicit. |
| `#inline-context` | Content injected into the effective message before model or tool execution. | A supported surface expands a valid context reference. | Original text remains traceable, expansion is bounded, and unsupported surfaces preserve raw text. |
| `#attached-context` | Appended context packet produced by reference expansion. | Expanded content is attached to a request. | Packet carries reference token, source, size, truncation, warning, refusal, and cost posture metadata. |
| `#kanban-board` | Durable Markdown task board shared across named profiles. | Work coordination should persist beyond one process, chat, or model run. | `kanban.md` rows parse through shared multi-dimensional table/Kanban utilities and remain Dev-only unless approved. |
| `#task-row` | One durable work item row. | A task needs owner, status, priority, evidence, acceptance, and next action fields. | Row id is stable, status is enumerated, and updates are conflict-aware. |
| `#profile-handoff` | Explicit row-level transfer between named agent profiles. | One worker pauses, delegates, resumes, or requests review from another profile. | Handoff row names source profile, target profile, context refs, blockers, acceptance, and resume state. |
| `#worker-process` | Full OS process worker with its own identity and runtime state. | Work should run outside fragile in-process subagent swarms. | Worker profile, command, cwd, proof, and cleanup boundary are explicit. |
| `#multi-agent-collaboration` | Durable collaboration through shared rows rather than transient subagents. | Several named profiles coordinate through board state. | Every task and handoff is readable/writable as rows, with no hidden process memory as SSOT. |
| `#adlc-observability` | Deterministic read-only projection of one immutable ADLC ledger into end-to-end execution, evidence, budget, gate, checkpoint, and release-receipt graph context. | `/adlc.observe #adlc-observability @implementation-run @canvas @runtime-proof` requests a local observation of one exact run and ledger revision. | Exact receipt schema and digest, stable node and edge identities, source-backed GraphData and Agentic OS Markdown, existing Canvas ownership, typed separation of `verified`, `delivery_ready`, and `deployed`, cache identity, zero model/network/token/cost evidence, and a closed Dev-only deploy boundary are explicit. |
| `#application-composition` | Exact versioned component and interface composition for agent and LLM applications. | An application joins agent, model, tool, workflow, memory, guardrail, or integration components without absorbing their runtimes. | Exact source and component revisions, interface and schema digests, negotiated capabilities, runtime owners, one immutable plan digest, a deterministic dependency DAG, and explicit non-mutating migration diagnostics are present before execution. |
| `#agentic-graph` | Local deterministic graph of source-backed codebase entities and relationships with auditable evidence. | A request generates a native parser or ingests, queries, traverses, or explains a graph derived from a bounded workspace containing code, docs, SQL, configs, or text-bearing PDFs. | Exact parser, registry, snapshot, and source digests, stable node and edge identities, deterministic ordering, typed omissions, and non-empty source evidence plus explanation for every edge are present; model, embedding, vector store, external parser, and external graph service paths are absent. |
| `#parser-generation` | Deterministic compilation of one inert parser-registry specification into a canonical registry of native parser adapter identities. | `/agentic.graph.parser.generate #agentic-graph #parser-generation #mcp @parser-specification @runtime-proof` requests the agentic-graph local MCP owner. | Exact result digest, bounded source matchers, deterministic conflict rejection, declared source kinds and fidelity, no executable caller payload, no downloaded adapter, zero model/network use, and no implicit ingest are proven. |
| `#tool-gateway` | Existing-infrastructure routing for tool calls. | A request uses web search, image generation, TTS, cloud browser, or another tool surface. | Tool route resolves to local MCP, Pages HTTP MCP, Browser WebMCP, or approved control-plane owner without adding a proxy. |
| `#tool-routing` | Per-tool provider selection and fallback. | A tool category can use gateway, direct, local, or unavailable provider state. | Provider state, fallback, approval, cost, and secret boundary are explicit before execution. |
| `#tool-function` | Callable function that extends agent capability. | A capability can be invoked as a typed tool call. | Function schema, owner, risk class, approval policy, cost posture, and typed fallback are present. |
| `#toolset` | Logical bundle of existing tool functions. | Several tools are enabled, disabled, discovered, or audited together. | Toolset resolves existing functions, reports missing entries, and does not copy external tool registries. |
| `#platform-toolset` | Platform-scoped toolset state. | Tool availability differs by CLI, chat, browser, MCP, or control-plane surface. | Enablement names the platform surface and does not imply global access. |
| `#tool-search` | Opt-in progressive disclosure for eligible deferred tools. | MCP or non-core plugin tool schemas would waste context before selection. | Activation policy, schema budget, session catalog, disabled state, and no-copy boundary are explicit. |
| `#deferred-tool-schema` | Tool schema hidden until a selected describe route loads it. | A deferred tool has been searched and now needs a full schema. | Schema is loaded only from the current session catalog and never from a stale global registry. |
| `#bridge-tool` | Small model-visible bridge used for search, describe, or call. | A deferred tool is invoked through a bridge instead of direct schema exposure. | Bridge unwraps to the real tool identity for validation, approval, hooks, audit, cost, and fallback. |
| `#web-search` | Web search and extraction tool category. | A task needs search, extraction, citations, or source fetch. | Source scope, citations, egress policy, cache behavior, and cost log are present. |
| `#image-generation` | Image generation tool category. | A task requests generated or edited images. | Approval, model/provider selection, prompt bounds, output manifest, and cost log are present. |
| `#voice-clone` | Authorized voice-profile derivation from one immutable source-audio artifact. | `/voice.studio` selects `clone` with `@audio` and `@voice-profile`. | Exact speaker consent, recording rights, permitted use, retention, disclosure, source digest, bounds, approval, cost, and revocation behavior are present before adapter work. |
| `#speech-to-text` | Authorized transcription of one immutable source-audio artifact into bounded text. | `/voice.studio` selects `dictate` with `@audio` and `@text`. | Recording rights, participant notice, language and segment bounds, source provenance, approval, cost, and uncertainty posture are present before adapter work. |
| `#text-to-speech` | Text-to-speech tool category, including the `/voice.studio` `create` route. | A task requests narration, voice note, or disclosed audio output from bounded text and, for Voice Studio, one exact active `@voice-profile` revision. | Voice/provider or profile authorization, text bounds, disclosure, output manifest, approval, cost, provenance, and revocation checks are present. |
| `#cloud-browser` | Cloud browser automation tool category. | A task requires remote browser navigation, click, type, vision, or screenshot actions. | Isolated session, action schema, redaction, approval gate, and trace proof are present. |
| `#skill-evolution` | Bounded improvement of reusable skill contracts. | Skill text is proposed or optimized through source-fenced epochs, mini-batches, and disjoint held-out validation. | Learning rate limits text mutation rather than model weights; every accepted candidate passes required gates and remains review-pending until separately managed. |
| `#skill-candidate` | An Agent Definition draft with `status: proposed` awaiting operator-gated promotion. | A Draft_Definition produced by the ACOS Skill_Proposer harness from a capability-gap signal is inspected. | Read-only inspection; the draft never enters the active registry or the tool allowlist, and promotion occurs only through the skill registry promotion gate with a resolvable operator instruction reference. |
| `#memory-search` | Scoped retrieval from local memory or past conversation indexes. | An agent needs prior decisions, proof, or preferences before acting. | Ranked sources cite local storage scope and return typed empty results when no match exists. |
| `#identity-model` | Stable, source-backed operator and project preference model. | A repeated preference or boundary should persist across sessions. | Store only non-secret, operator-relevant, source-backed facts; reject unsupported personal inference. |
| `#orchestration-graph` | State, node, edge, and compile-check contract for agent workflows. | A workflow needs explicit topology, conditional routing, parallel branches, or bounded loops. | State schema, node ids, edge rules, entry/exit nodes, stop condition, and orphan-node check are present. |
| `#role-based-agent-team` | Exact source-backed collaboration among named agent-definition revisions and one registered orchestration workflow. | A task needs declared roles, goals, or personas while retaining existing delegate, handoff, guardrail, model, tool, review, and persistence owners. | `/agent.team #role-based-agent-team @agent-team`, four `agentic-graph.agent_team.*` lifecycle tools, revision and state fences, hard turn/depth/fanout/retry/time/token/cost bounds, private intermediates, and exact final-answer ownership are proven; role metadata grants no authority. |
| `#agent-swarm` | Dynamic bounded horizontal work decomposition for one base-agent goal. | Independent work can overlap and does not require predefined specialists or a handcrafted workflow. | Runtime-generated tasks, session-owned durable atomic claims, observed bounded overlap, isolated contexts, recovery, verified receipts, and base-agent synthesis are proven. |
| `#agent-toolkit` | Cross-cutting observation, bounded evaluation, evidence-backed comparison, and reviewed learning for digest-bound agent-system revisions. | A digest-bound agent or team revision and framework-neutral adapter require metadata-only analysis without changing the execution owner. | Caller-declared digests and application authority, server timing, telemetry trust, bounded unique evidence, metric direction, honest cost, deterministic same-cohort policy, and review-pending learning are explicit. |
| `#stateful-agent` | Long-running agent with explicit state across turns or sessions. | A run persists working state, memory, checkpoints, or resumable context. | State owner, memory boundary, checkpoint plan, and resume behavior are named. |
| `#durable-execution` | Fault-tolerant execution that can resume after interruption or failure. | A run may exceed one request, retry, pause, crash, or recover. | Checkpoint, idempotency, retry, timeout, circuit breaker, and recovery VCCs are present. |
| `#human-in-loop` | Operator inspection or approval inside a run. | A workflow pauses for human review, editing, approval, or rejection. | Interrupt payload, resume payload, audit event, and approval gate are typed. |
| `#long-horizon-harness` | Minutes-to-hours agent workflow for research, coding, or creation. | A task spans multiple tools, skills, memory reads, artifacts, and verification steps. | Goal, graph, checkpoints, sandbox scope, message gateway, stop conditions, artifacts, proof, and cost ledger are typed. |
| `#sandboxed-workspace` | Isolated or scoped filesystem/execution workspace for agent-created artifacts. | A run reads, writes, edits, executes, or summarizes generated files. | Workspace root, allowed operations, artifact manifest, diff summary, secret scan, cleanup, and approval gates are explicit. |
| `#agent-sandbox-policy` | Native declarative deny-first policy for agent filesystem, process, network, credential, and audit decisions. | An autonomous or tool-bearing run needs preflight authorization. | Policy source, digest, typed decision, redacted audit result, and OS/kernel enforcement gap are explicit. |
| `#message-gateway` | Typed handoff channel between user, agent, worker, tool, and review stages. | A workflow fans out, pauses, resumes, or sends tool/status messages across actors. | Message schema, sender, recipient, state transition, replay/idempotency rule, and visibility boundary are present. |
| `#payment-rail-selection` | Deterministic choice of exactly one settlement rail for one payment intent. | More than one provider-backed settlement path can serve a requested currency or settlement asset. | Selection inputs, the selected rail identifier, and the selection reason are recorded before any provider call, identical inputs return identical output, and no ready rail returns a typed unavailable result. |
| `#payment-idempotency` | Replay-safe creation of a provider payment object behind a client-generated intent key. | A payment request can be retried after a lost response, a reconnect, or an agent retry. | The key is derived from the client intent key without a personal identifier, a replay yields exactly one provider object, and a changed-parameter replay returns a typed conflict instead of a second object. |
| `#payment-settlement-integrity` | At-most-once settlement from authenticated events and provider-authoritative state. | An inbound provider callback or a reconciliation pass could unlock paid capability. | Event authenticity is verified before payload read, provider state is the authority, a paid transition requires matching intent identifier, minor-unit amount, and currency, and duplicate delivery produces one side effect. |
| `#offline-intent-queue` | Locally durable payment intent held while the server-side trust boundary is unreachable. | A payment is confirmed with no network path, or a client reloads before submission. | The queue survives reload with zero egress, carries no credential or account identifier, submits in creation order one intent key at a time, and never asserts payment on its own. |
| `#payment-data-minimization` | Smallest regulated-data footprint that still supports audit. | Payment data is stored, projected into a receipt, sent to a provider, or exposed to a caller. | No card number, verification value, or full bank account number is stored, no personal identifier enters an idempotency key or provider metadata, no payment record field enters a model prompt, and the public status projection carries only its permitted fields. |
| `#payment-readiness` | Per-rail proof that a settlement rail is configured well enough to accept money. | A rail is about to be enabled, re-enabled, or exposed to a buyer or agent. | Required credential names, server-side presence, absence from visible configuration, pinned provider version, configured integration model, and one terminal sandbox payment are reported read-only, with a non-zero exit on any missing required input. |
| `#workspace-parallelism` | Concurrent sessions working across sibling repositories in one workspace root as the intended mode. | More than one session, device, or tool can hold live work in the workspace at the same time. | Lane ownership, branch exclusivity, and scope exclusivity are each proven separately, every at-risk lane is named, and serialization is never used as the safety mechanism. |
| `#coordination-scheduler` | Read-only partitioning of independently authorized tasks into bounded dependency-aware waves. | `/coordination.schedule @coordination-plan` receives exact authority states, write sets, dependencies, and findings. | Only current claims schedule; overlap and capacity serialize locally; proven disjoint global attention remains visible without blocking; the report performs no mutation. |
| `#goal-completion` | Adaptive, outcome-weighted, non-blocking advance scope for one declared goal. | `/goal.advance @goal-plan` supplies units, authority states, write sets, dependencies, gates, and recorded outcomes. | Heuristic weights rank but never admit, gate, or unblock; gates fail closed without an exact authorization; blocked units bound only themselves and their dependents; the receipt is deterministic, frozen, and performs no dispatch or mutation. |

## VCCs

| VCC | Check |
|---|---|
| Dictionary parses | Frontmatter parses as YAML and `dictionary_entries` lists hash-prefixed tokens. |
| Tags are MECE enough for routing | Each tag row has distinct meaning, match criteria, and proof. |
| No semantic backfill | Tags do not mark runtime-ready without runtime proof. |
| No duplicate registry | Body states shared utilities own routing and no new semantic registry is created. |
| Observation semantics do not promote state | `#adlc-observability` preserves the ledger's typed `verified`, `delivery_ready`, and `deployed` evidence and creates no verdict, delivery, authorization, or deployment authority. |
