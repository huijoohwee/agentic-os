# Binding Dictionary

This file defines `@` binding-route content owned by agentic-os and reused by consumers. Bindings attach commands and semantic filters to an actor, source, runtime surface, proof artifact, or boundary. They are references only; they do not store secrets or authorize deployment.

Product document references resolve against `agentic-canvas-os/docs` unless repository-qualified.
Dictionary references resolve within this directory. Runtime and approval claims remain consumer-owned.

## Contract

| Rule | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Route owner | Existing shared `@` utilities own binding detection and insertion. |
| Dictionary role | This file names binding meaning, authority, and fail-closed behavior. |
| Runtime status | Spec-complete until a shared runtime owner resolves the binding. |
| Secret policy | Bindings never contain raw credentials, provider keys, browser sessions, or media tokens. |
| Deploy policy | `@prod-mirror` and `@cloudflare` are gated boundaries, not default edit targets. |

## Consumer Metadata

| Consumer | Metadata read | Source fields | Runtime boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| Chat composer | Token, label, summary, group, sourcePath, keywords, prefix role. | `dictionary_entries`; Bindings table Meaning, Authority, and Boundary. | Inserts the `@` token and preserves the editable query; unknown bindings stay raw text. |
| Skills & Commands catalog | Token, label, summary, group, sourcePath, keywords, prefix role. | Same source fields as chat composer. | Renders searchable rows and active-card insertion without copying a panel-local binding list. |
| MCP | Token, prefix, meaning, authority, boundary, secret policy, publish policy, source docs, full-catalog counts, and catalog digest. | Bindings table plus frontmatter policy fields; deterministic digest input is token, kind, label, summary, and source path across all three dictionaries. | Metadata is reference and binding context only; every sigil query returns the same full-catalog digest, and bindings do not store secrets, approve tool calls, or become executable MCP tools. |

## Bindings

| Binding | Meaning | Authority | Boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| `@agent` | Executing agent bound by `FACTS.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and explicit operator instructions. | Current runtime agent. | Must consult facts before memory, keep role behavior separate from truth, and fail closed on spend, mutation, or deploy gaps. |
| `@soul-profile` | Durable source-backed agent identity and voice. | `SOUL.md` plus approved prompt-assembly owner. | Identity only; no project commands, architecture notes, file paths, ports, credentials, memory facts, or deploy approvals. |
| `@identity-slot` | Prompt slot 1 identity position. | Approved prompt-assembly owner. | Must be filled from scanned `@soul-profile` or a typed fallback result; silent hardcoded default identity is forbidden. |
| `@personality-overlay` | Temporary session-level style overlay. | Operator-approved session state. | Overlay cannot mutate `SOUL.md`, override facts, bypass safety, or authorize deploy. |
| `@moa-preset` | Local neutral MoA preset binding for reference roles, aggregator role, caps, and fail-soft failure classification. | `FACTS.md`, `SKILLS.md`, and the approved local model router or harness owner. | Must not contain copied provider examples, hardcoded external model ids, recursive MoA aggregators, or global model-switch side effects. |
| `@reference-agents` | Bounded advisory agents in a Mixture of Agents run. | Approved local harness or provider router. | No tools, no source mutation, capped output, all-settled typed outcomes, sanitized failure audit, aggregate counts, cost logging, and private advisory context only. |
| `@aggregator-agent` | Single acting agent in a Mixture of Agents run. | Approved local harness or provider router. | Owns final answer, tool calls, approvals, transcript persistence, and follow-up iteration through normal gates. |
| `@operator` | Human approval authority and final release gate. | The user. | Required before paid, mutating, payment, browser-auth, Prod, or Cloudflare actions. |
| `@source.frontmatter` | Parsed YAML frontmatter. | Authored document source. | SSOT for identity, routing, renderer flags, and runtime gates. |
| `@ecs-session` | Opaque id for one bounded in-memory ECS world hydrated from a validated KGC document. | agentic-graph's private ECS MCP session store. | Session ids grant no filesystem path, network, deployment, or caller-authored decision authority; TTL, maximum count, terminal persistence, and lazy sweep bound their lifetime. |
| `@source.body` | Authored Markdown body. | Authored document source. | SSOT for operator workflow, guardrails, and checklist language. |
| `@local-harness` | Dev-local typed harness or dry-run path. | Shared local runtime owner. | Default proof path before paid calls or deploy. |
| `@runtime-proof` | Surfaced validation evidence. | Command output, typed result, parsed field, or focused test. | Must be observable; narrative alone is not proof. |
| `@instruction-source` | One audited durable-guidance or skill-catalog source. | `docs/AGENTS.md` or `docs/SKILLS.md`. | Read-only audit input; it grants no rewrite, runtime, release, or deployment authority. |
| `@instruction-eval-suite` | Repository-owned final-answer scenarios and scoring rules for instruction quality. | `evals/instruction-task-quality-cases.json` and `INSTRUCTION-QUALITY-EVALUATION.md`. | Read-only evaluation input; candidate execution, human approval, release, and deployment remain separate authorities. |
| `@dev-only` | Local development boundary. | Current canonical Dev checkout. | Confirms work stops before Prod mirror and Cloudflare. |
| `@cost-log` | Token, cache, and estimated cost ledger. | Harness observer or runtime result. | Must report exact zero for model-free views. |
| `@video-generation-demo-script` | Authored source-script binding for the default video-agent preset. | The preset frontmatter plus its canonical workspace Markdown reference. | Source context only; it cannot contain generated artifact identities, credentials, provider job ids, or fabricated media URLs. |
| `@provider.byteplus` | Select the existing BytePlus ModelArk generation route. | Shared provider settings and generation-runtime owner. | Selection carries no credential and fails before spend when endpoint, model, entitlement, or credential is unavailable. |
| `@provider.openai` | Select the existing OpenAI generation route. | Shared provider settings and generation-runtime owner. | Selection carries no credential and fails before spend when endpoint, model, entitlement, or credential is unavailable. |
| `@text` | Request a structured text artifact. | Shared text-generation and workspace-artifact owners. | The video preset requires Character, Scene, Dialogue, Visual asset, Audio, Timing, Metadata, and Prompt sheets; empty or malformed output fails terminally. |
| `@image` | Request source-consistent image artifacts. | Shared image-generation, persistence, Media, and Canvas projection owners. | Only provider-returned and read-back-verified image identities may project; no fabricated or localhost-only URL is accepted as durable output. |
| `@image-to-threejs` | Bind one existing PNG, JPG, JPEG, or SVG source to the native `image.to-threejs` conversion. | Shared Card, Widget, image-to-threejs, and Rich Media Panel owners. | Uses the selected source URL only; no credential, provider generation, external plugin, or deploy authority is introduced. |
| `@image-to-glb` | Bind one existing PNG, JPG, JPEG, or SVG source to the native procedural `image.to-glb` asset contract. | Shared Card, Widget, image-to-threejs source utilities, and GLB asset-pipeline owners. | Uses only the selected source URL; source media remains unchanged, external plugin/copy paths are forbidden, and any LLM execution requires its separately approved runtime. |
| `@agentic-graph.probe-tree` | Bind one Widget Card or answered branch to the shared Probe-Tree generation context. | Authored graph identity, selected child Output including numbered multi-selections and Other, bounded ancestor lineage, local MCP Probe-Tree tools, shared Storyboard publication owners, and the active Chat provider, endpoint, and model. | Carries no credentials or implicit provider approval; the selected child replaces any same-ID root alias as continuation owner, every accepted question and clarification suggestion traces to the selected child or bounded lineage through verbatim anchors, generation is bounded, forward-only, page-stable, and zero-spend by default, stale card-local routing is forbidden, and graph mutation remains atomic through the owning publication transaction. |
| `@audio` | Request narration, dialogue, sound, music, subtitle-sync, and master-audio artifacts. | Shared audio/video generation, media-probe, persistence, and Timeline owners. | Languages, synchronization, media kind, persistence, and read-back identity must be typed before projection. |
| `@voice-profile` | Bind one exact revision of a consented voice-profile manifest for profile creation or disclosed synthesis. | agentic-graph's voice-studio runtime resolves opaque profile identity, source digests, speaker authorization, permitted uses, retention, disclosure, and revocation state through existing media and policy owners. | It contains no voice embedding, raw audio, credential, mutable provider alias, or implicit consent; a missing, expired, mismatched, or revoked profile blocks adapter work, spend, persistence, and output. |
| `@video` | Request playable video artifacts and final composition. | Shared video-generation, composition, persistence, Media, and Timeline owners. | Completion requires returned or composed playable bytes, media verification, persistence, read-back, and one durable identity across Canvas surfaces. |
| `@mcp-gateway` | Discovery-first MCP federation surface. | Existing local, Pages, browser, or control-plane MCP owner. | Discovery is zero-token; spend routes through approval gates. |
| `@webmcp-surface` | Browser-local W3C Model Context registration surface pinned to `navigator.modelContext.registerTool` with `signal` and `exposedTo` options and `getTools({ fromOrigins })` discovery, at origin-trial stage and unshipped by default in every recorded engine. | Existing browser-local agentic-graph Canvas owner; this repository declares the surface and its recorded API revision but registers no tool of its own. | Carries no renderer, storage, credential, spend, Prod, or Cloudflare authority; an absent or renamed registration API fails visibly as an unavailable surface, and a registered set whose digest drifts from the recorded set is refused rather than served. |
| `@canvas` | Source-backed Canvas projection and active browser-local Canvas control surface. | Existing Source Files, frontmatter, KGC, table, Storyboard, Main Toolbar, Launch, Canvas View, and Interaction owners. | No dashboard-only graph store or renderer fork. Semantic row-value and toolbar-action invocations bind to existing owners and add no panel-local state, credential, collaboration grant, or deployment authority. |
| `@portability-layer` | Shared capability-detected portability contract consumed by browser and native Agentic Game OS projections. | agentic-graph shared substrate and its source-backed public portability surface; Agentic Canvas OS owns invocation metadata and GameXR owns frontend projection only. | No renderer, capability implementation, persistence engine, token registry, credential, provider, model, infrastructure, Prod, Cloudflare, or deploy authority; an unsupported capability remains a typed gap rather than a local fallback. |
| `@canvas-view` | Active browser-local Canvas View Mode control surface and its canonical option-id inventory. | Existing Canvas View toolbar options, shared selection action, semantic row affordances, and browser-local WebMCP bridge. | Carries no renderer, storage, collaboration, credential, or deployment authority; an unavailable or disabled option fails visibly before mutation. |
| `@scene` | Current canonical XR scene and immersive placement scope. | Browser-local agentic-graph scene, hit-test, and shared Canvas projection owners. | Carries no camera or sensor grant and creates no duplicate renderer, persistence owner, approval, credential, Prod, or Cloudflare authority. |
| `@camera` | First-class shared Camera framing and XR motion runtime. | Application-root Camera runtime, shared framing utilities, and canonical BottomPanel Timeline transport. | Does not create a panel-local Camera store, timeline, selection owner, credential, or deployment grant. |
| `@selected-actor` | Actor selected for framing, cast marks, or camera choreography. | Shared Canvas graph selection and XR cast runtime. | Missing actor selection fails closed; the binding never keeps a FloatingPanel-only selection copy. |
| `@selected-node` | Current Canvas node selection resolved through shared graph selection state. | Existing Canvas selection owner. | Missing selection returns a typed no-selection result; commands must not keep a panel-local selected-node cache. |
| `@selected-edge` | Current Canvas edge selection resolved through shared graph selection state. | Existing Canvas selection owner. | Missing selection returns a typed no-selection result; endpoint updates must validate against current graph data. |
| `@canvas-center` | Resolved graph-space insertion point from the current visible Canvas viewport. | Existing zoom/pan viewport and canvas projection utilities. | Point must be derived from current viewport transform, not a hardcoded panel or screen coordinate. |
| `@viewport-readout` | Current viewport size, zoom percent, and world-space center from shared viewport utilities. | Existing viewport measurement and zoom projection owners. | Read-only telemetry; missing dimensions return typed empty state instead of synthetic defaults. |
| `@viewport-transform` | Active zoom transform with scale and screen-space translation. | Existing D3/zoom state and projection utilities. | Transform values must be read from active renderer state and clamped by shared zoom bounds. |
| `@zoom-mode` | Fit, selection, pinning, duration, and scale extent state for canvas zoom behavior. | Existing auto-zoom, runtime zoom dispatch, and schema owners. | Does not authorize auto-fit or pinning changes without an explicit command route and supported renderer state. |
| `@wheel-input` | Wheel or trackpad behavior, modifier boost, and gesture preset context. | Existing camera-options and wheel-target guard owners. | Gesture routing preserves overlay guards and never bypasses scroll/input ownership. |
| `@interaction-speed` | Pan, zoom, and global interaction speed multipliers. | Existing schema, canvas runtime, and store settings owners. | Values clamp through shared owners and must not be stored as panel-local copies. |
| `@flow-run-mode` | Canvas run mode plus Flow wheel and overlay interaction state. | Existing toolbar run-mode owner, Flow renderer owners, and shared store. | Run-mode changes stay in the toolbar/store path; Flow overlay changes stay renderer-owned. |
| `@drag-alpha-target` | D3 drag alpha target used by the 2D simulation during canvas dragging. | Existing graph store and D3 simulation tuning owner. | Value is simulation tuning only; missing simulation state returns typed unsupported result. |
| `@media-url` | Approved media URL or inline media reference for node media metadata or bounded immersive-media projection. | Shared media inventory, inline media command candidates, or explicit operator input. | Must validate kind and reference; no generated URLs, credentials, remote discovery, or stale fixtures are stored. |
| `@markdown-provenance` | Document path and line range provenance for opening selected Canvas records in source. | Parsed node/edge properties and workspace document owners. | Missing provenance keeps open actions on implemented graph surfaces and does not invent a source path. |
| `@layout-forces` | Schema-owned Canvas layout force values for anti-line and post-fit tuning. | Graph schema owner. | Values clamp through schema rules and reset/preset writes stay in schema state rather than toolbar-local state. |
| `@physics-2d` | Schema-owned charge, collision, speed, overlap, label, and drag-force tuning for 2D layout. | Graph schema physics tuning owner. | Values are clamped, reset, and proven through schema state; no floating-panel slider state is authoritative. |
| `@centroid-target` | Selection, all-items, or viewport target used by center and centroid arrange commands. | Shared arrange, selection, and centroid utilities. | Target scope must be explicit and selection-dependent commands fail closed when selection is absent. |
| `@spread-axis` | Requested horizontal or vertical axis for even-spread arrange operations. | Shared arrange utilities. | Axis and selected-node count are validated before mutation. |
| `@performance-overlay` | Canvas performance overlay state and diagnostic readout source. | Shared performance overlay and pipeline performance owners. | Diagnostics are read-only by default and do not imply continuous polling or panel-local monitoring. |
| `@edge-endpoint` | Candidate source or target endpoint for a Canvas edge request. | Shared graph lookup and edge request owner. | Endpoint id must exist in the current graph; duplicate or stale endpoints fail before mutation. |
| `@approval-gate` | Explicit gate state for spend, mutation, payment, browser auth, or deploy. | Shared gate catalog or harness result. | Missing approval blocks before action. |
| `@prod-mirror` | Prod mirror path for release staging. | Operator-approved release flow only. | Not a default edit target; forbidden without explicit instruction. |
| `@cloudflare` | Cloudflare route or Worker/Pages control plane. | Operator-approved deploy flow only. | Not a completion criterion for docs-only work. |
| `@experience` | Typed record of a run, failure, proof packet, or operator correction. | Authored source plus surfaced runtime proof. | May seed proposals only after provenance, applicability, expiry risk, and no-copy boundary are recorded. |
| `@memory-store` | Bounded agent-note store for environment facts, conventions, lessons, and project context. | `MEMORY.md` plus approved local memory owner. | Read is scoped; writes require scan, capacity check, duplicate handling, and must exclude secrets, unsupported inference, and deploy artifacts. |
| `@memory-entry` | One compact memory or profile entry. | Approved memory write request. | Entry must name target, evidence, write action, scan result, capacity result, and source. |
| `@memory-snapshot` | Frozen memory/profile context captured at session start. | Approved prompt assembly owner. | Active prompt snapshot is immutable; mid-session writes affect future sessions or live tool responses only. |
| `@memory-policy` | Capacity, write approval, scan, duplicate, and compaction policy. | `FACTS.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `USER.md`, and approved runtime owner. | Unsafe, overflowing, duplicate, or unsupported writes fail closed with typed result. |
| `@user-profile` | Bounded user profile for explicit preferences, communication style, and expectations. | `USER.md` plus operator-approved profile owner. | No unsupported personal inference, secrets, sensitive profiling, project operations, or stale session details. |
| `@session-index` | Searchable past-session record index. | Approved local session-search owner. | Read-only search by default; results require explicit capture before persistence. |
| `@skill-index` | Lightweight skill metadata index. | `SKILLS.md` plus approved shared skill registry owner. | Index entries include metadata only; full instruction bodies and secrets stay out until selected. |
| `@skill-source` | One selected skill source document. | `SKILL.md`-compatible source under an approved skill root. | Must parse, remain bounded, avoid copied external artifacts, and load only after selection. |
| `@skill-reference` | Optional skill resource such as references, scripts, templates, or assets. | Approved skill root and resource path. | Load on demand, keep references shallow, validate before execution, and reject unsafe paths. |
| `@skill-bundle` | Bundle manifest that groups existing skill ids. | Approved bundle source. | Resolves installed skills, reports missing entries, and cannot override approval or deploy gates. |
| `@skill-policy` | Skill trust, scan, compatibility, write approval, and validation policy. | `FACTS.md`, `SKILLS.md`, `VALIDATION-RUNBOOK.md`, and approved runtime owner. | Unsafe external sources, incompatible requirements, copied artifacts, or unreviewed writes fail closed. |
| `@context-file` | One discovered project-local context file. | Working directory, ancestor, or touched subdirectory under the approved project scope. | Read-only unless operator requests edits; must scan, bound, and never override `FACTS.md`, `SOUL.md`, system, developer, or operator instructions. |
| `@working-directory` | Current startup or tool-call working directory used for context discovery. | Runtime session state or explicit operator path. | Must be explicit, normalized, and scoped; no home-wide or global scan unless approved. |
| `@repository-root` | Exact local Git worktree root selected for deterministic repository packing. | Explicit operator path resolved under the configured agentic-graph local MCP root. | Must equal Git's canonical worktree root after symlink-safe validation; it grants reads only within that root and one content-addressed write under the approved output directory. |
| `@artifact-operation` | One normalized workspace artifact operation: inspect, create file, create folder, update file, import file, export file, trash, or restore. | Explicit request field accepted by the selected lifecycle owner. | Grants only the named operation; plan is read-only, apply additionally requires `@operator`, and recursive import/export or purge is unsupported until separately specified and proven. |
| `@workspace-entry` | One relative file or folder path inside an explicitly configured workspace root, plus a source or destination path when the selected operation requires it. | Operator-selected path resolved by the local MCP owner against configured roots. | Traversal, reserved names, special files, undeclared roots, and every symlink component fail before read or mutation; the binding never grants network, provider, repository, Prod, or deployment authority. |
| `@artifact-policy` | Collision, bounds, atomicity, and recovery policy for one workspace artifact operation. | Host defaults narrowed by explicit request values. | Cannot weaken configured roots or security limits; replace requires an expected digest, idempotent identical reuse is explicit, mutations use atomic publication and read-back, and typed recovery evidence is returned without hidden deletion. |
| `@context-policy` | Precedence, scan, truncation, and progressive-discovery rules for context files. | `FACTS.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `VALIDATION-RUNBOOK.md`, and approved runtime owner. | First-match project context, per-directory visited set, prompt-injection block, capacity bound, and deploy gate are required. |
| `@file:` | Context reference to one workspace file or 1-indexed line range. | Explicit message text plus normalized workspace path. | Text only, workspace-scoped, sensitive path blocked, path traversal blocked, binary rejected, and bounded before expansion. |
| `@folder:` | Context reference to a directory listing or bounded folder summary. | Explicit message text plus normalized workspace directory. | Maximum entry cap, no recursive content dump by default, sensitive children skipped with warnings. |
| `@diff` | Context reference to the current unstaged diff. | Current canonical VCS checkout. | Read-only, secret-scanned, bounded, and never treated as approval to write or revert. |
| `@staged` | Context reference to the current staged diff. | Current VCS index. | Read-only, secret-scanned, bounded, and never treated as commit approval. |
| `@git:` | Context reference to recent commit metadata or patch range. | Current VCS repository. | Count is clamped to a small maximum, missing revisions warn, and sensitive content remains blocked. |
| `@local-git-repository` | Browser-owned persisted Git object, ref, worktree, and outbox state. | agentic-graph storage-engine IndexedDB owner. | Carries no credential; controls require active IndexedDB, bounded paths and objects, atomic authority checks, and typed offline state. |
| `@git-remote` | Opaque configured remote alias used for browser Git fetch or push. | Authenticated Dev Worker storage relay and its static allowlist. | Browser payloads contain neither credentials nor upstream URLs; the relay revalidates loopback origin, membership, role, size, path, and compare-before-update state. |
| `@git-guidelines` | Git guidelines source. | `../node_modules/agentic-os/docs/adlc-guidelines.md`. | Source-only binding; it grants no mutation, integration, release, publication, or deployment authority. |
| `@persisted-cache` | Browser-owned binary and metadata cache used by file synchronization. | agentic-graph storage-engine IndexedDB owner. | Chunked values stay within browser limits, credentials are rejected, and degraded persistence blocks mutating controls. |
| `@file-sync-provider` | Opaque configured provider alias for file or directory pull and push. | Authenticated Dev Worker provider registry. | Alias exposes no provider resource id or credential; unsupported native documents, shortcuts, symlinks, and unverifiable hashes fail explicitly. |
| `@url:` | Operator-provided reference to bounded external content for context expansion or source import. | Approved URL fetch, extract, or Import URL owner. | Requires `@reference-policy`, egress policy, cache/citation metadata, size bounds, and no credentials in the URL or headers. |
| `@reference-policy` | Workspace, scan, size, platform, URL egress, warning, and refusal rules for context references. | `FACTS.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `VALIDATION-RUNBOOK.md`, and approved composer or CLI owner. | Missing policy preserves raw text; unsupported surfaces pass raw `@` references through with typed warning. |
| `@attached-context` | Bounded appended context packet produced by reference expansion. | Approved `/reference.expand` runtime owner. | Packet records source token, normalized source, size, truncation, warnings, refusal, and cost posture. |
| `@kanban-board` | Durable `kanban.md` task board. | Authored Markdown table source plus existing multi-dimensional table/Kanban utilities. | Board rows are the SSOT for task and handoff state; no browser-only, process-only, or copied board store. |
| `@task-row` | One validated task row in `kanban.md`. | Shared table row parser and operator-approved task schema. | Requires stable id, title, owner profile, status, priority, acceptance, evidence, and next action. |
| `@implementation-run` | Immutable identity and revision for one externally owned implementation-run receipt. | The caller-selected receipt source; ACOS consumes it only through the read-only `/adlc.observe` projection. | Carries no worktree, branch, lease, claim, review, integration, release, cleanup, or deployment authority. |
| `@application-manifest` | Bounded source-backed application slots, dependency edges, entrypoints, outputs, bounds, and exact revisions and digests. | Authored application source selected by the operator or project owner. | No latest tags, ranges, fallbacks, callbacks, packages, commands, endpoints, headers, environment maps, credentials, or embedded code. |
| `@component-catalog` | Immutable exact component, source, interface, schema, capability, runtime-owner, risk, and readiness records. | agentic-graph local component catalog owner. | Same-revision drift, missing evidence, disabled records, and implicit fallback or upgrade block planning. |
| `@integration-profile` | Opaque host-approved integration id, exact profile revision, and exact declared capability revision. | Existing integration registry, gateway, or transport owner. | Executable, arguments, transport, endpoint, headers, secrets, credentials, sessions, and provider payloads remain owner-private. |
| `@agentic-graph` | One exact digest-fenced local graph snapshot view plus its source, parser, diagnostic, and artifact manifest. | agentic-graph artifact owner under an explicitly configured local boundary. | The binding is not a database credential, global index, vector store, approval, or executable graph; replacement makes prior expected digests stale, source files stay authored SSOT, and query or explanation cannot select or mutate another snapshot. |
| `@parser-specification` | One immutable inert parser-registry specification containing bounded source matchers, declared kinds, native adapter identities, fidelity, and deterministic priority. | Operator-selected authored source resolved by the agentic-graph local MCP parser-generator owner. | It contains no executable code, adapter implementation, command, dependency, credential, remote endpoint, model prompt, artifact path, implicit ingest authority, or mutable alias; ambiguous or unsupported adapter declarations fail before compilation. |
| `@handoff-row` | One validated handoff row in `kanban.md`. | Shared table row parser and named profiles. | Requires from profile, to profile, task id, context refs, blockers, resume state, and acceptance criteria. |
| `@agent-profile` | Named profile that can own or receive board work. | `SOUL.md`, `USER.md`, profile config, or explicit operator-defined profile source. | Profile identity is explicit and non-secret; it cannot imply deploy, spend, or hidden memory ownership. |
| `@worker-process` | Full OS process worker for a named profile. | Approved local process launcher or operator-run terminal. | Process has cwd, identity, command, proof, cleanup, and resource bounds; no fragile in-process subagent swarm. |
| `@tool-gateway` | Existing `agentic-graph` tool routing surface. | Local MCP, Pages HTTP MCP, Browser WebMCP, or approved Cloudflare control-plane owner. | No new proxy, no copied gateway, and no deploy claim without explicit approval. |
| `@tool-provider` | Provider state for a specific tool category. | Approved provider router or settings owner. | Gateway, direct, local, or unavailable state only; raw credentials stay server-managed. |
| `@tool-function` | One callable function that extends agent capability. | Existing MCP, local harness, browser, source, or control-plane owner. | Must declare schema, owner, risk class, cost posture, and typed fallback without secrets. |
| `@toolset` | Logical bundle of existing tool functions. | `SKILLS.md`, `MCP-GATEWAY.md`, and approved tool catalog owner. | Resolves existing functions only; cannot install, invent, or globally enable tools. |
| `@platform-surface` | CLI, FloatingPanel Chat, browser, MCP, or control-plane surface. | Approved runtime surface owner. | Toolset state is scoped to this surface and cannot grant cross-platform access implicitly. |
| `@deferred-tool-catalog` | Session-scoped catalog of eligible deferred tools. | Approved tool catalog owner assembled from current MCP and plugin toolsets. | Rebuilt from currently granted tools; cannot expose core direct tools, disabled tools, or global registry entries. |
| `@bridge-tool` | Model-visible bridge surface for deferred tool search, describe, or call. | Approved tool-search harness owner. | Cannot bypass real tool schema validation, approval, hooks, audit, cost logging, or fallback. |
| `@web-search-tool` | Search and extraction capability. | Approved search/extract harness. | Requires source scope, citations, egress policy, cache policy, and cost log. |
| `@image-tool` | Image generation capability. | Approved image harness. | Requires approval, prompt bounds, artifact manifest, and cost log. |
| `@tts-tool` | Text-to-speech capability. | Approved audio harness. | Requires voice/provider, text bounds, output manifest, and cost log. |
| `@browser-tool` | Cloud browser automation capability. | Approved browser automation harness. | Requires isolated session, action schema, redaction, screenshots or vision bounds, and approval. |
| `@tool-policy` | Tool approval, egress, secret, cost, and fallback policy. | `FACTS.md`, `MCP-GATEWAY.md`, `HARNESS-CONTRACTS.md`, and approved runtime owner. | Paid, mutating, browser-auth, generated-media, and deploy actions fail closed without approval. |
| `@skill-catalog` | Reusable skill contract catalog. | `SKILLS.md` plus existing shared skill registry owner when present. | Skill changes are proposals until reviewed; direct auto-commit and external copying are forbidden. |
| `@skill-registry` | In-Worker Agent Definition registry created by `createAgentDefinitionRegistry` plus its `Active_Registry_Snapshot` projection. | `agent-api/src/agent-definitions.js` inside the Cloudflare Worker declared in `wrangler.jsonc`. | Distinct from `@skill-catalog`, which resolves to skill text contracts; this binding is read-only from the invocation surface, dispatches only `status: active` definitions, and promotion to active requires the operator-gated skill registry promotion gate. |
| `@identity-model` | Stable model of operator preferences, project boundaries, and agent operating rules. | `FACTS.md`, `MEMORY.md`, and operator-approved memory. | Stores non-secret, source-backed facts only; no sensitive profiling or unsupported personal inference. |
| `@orchestration-graph` | Source-backed state, node, edge, and stop-condition topology. | `SKILLS.md`, `HARNESS-CONTRACTS.md`, and existing Canvas/KGC graph owners. | No external graph runtime import, hidden node registry, or direct graph-store mutation. |
| `@agent-team` | Exact source URI and digest, team revision, participant-to-Agent-Definition revisions, registered workflow revision and branches, role metadata, review policy, and hard bounds. | `AGENT-TEAM.md` defines the source contract; agentic-graph local stdio MCP owns durable lifecycle state; existing agent owners retain execution authority. | Roles, goals, personas, membership, and MCP requests cannot grant facts, instructions, models, tools, credentials, approval, routing, final-answer ownership, Prod, or Cloudflare authority; drift and mutable aliases fail closed. |
| `@swarm-run` | Durable ledger for one dynamically planned Agent Swarm run. | `AGENT-SWARM.md`, Agent Swarm runtime, and the injected atomic state-store adapter. | Holds bounded private task results for dependencies and synthesis plus state, claims, leases, verified receipts, cost, and trace; never exposes those results publicly or stores provider secrets, caller roles, or workflow topology. |
| `@goal-plan` | One declared goal binding its unit set, gates, explicit authorizations, and recorded prior outcomes. | `GOAL-COMPLETION-RUNTIME.md` and `scripts/goal-completion-runtime-contract.mjs`; readiness and waves remain owned by the coordination scheduler. | Carries no claim, lease, dispatcher, timer, or provider credential; recorded outcomes are observations only, and neither a weight nor a gate authorization grants mutation, integration, release, or deployment authority. |
| `@agent-toolkit-observer` | Injected metadata observer and digest-bound evaluator for one Toolkit principal. | `AGENT-TOOLKIT.md`, Agent Toolkit runtime, and the application-owned authorizer, adapter, or evaluator. | Accepts bounded redacted lifecycle metadata, declared metrics, unique evidence references, and owner-aggregate cost; caller-declared digests need application verification, and remote telemetry stays untrusted and comparison-ineligible. |
| `@state-store` | Scoped current-state snapshot for a stateful run. | Existing approved local state owner. | Typed, bounded, secret-free state only; writes require mutation approval. |
| `@checkpoint-store` | Durable checkpoint and resume surface. | Existing approved local persistence owner. | Checkpoints require scope, recovery proof, idempotency, and cleanup path. |
| `@human-review` | Operator review interrupt and resume binding. | The operator or approved review gate. | Continuation is blocked until approve, reject, or edit result is typed. |
| `@sandbox-workspace` | Scoped workspace for long-horizon agent file reads, writes, execution, uploads, and outputs. | Approved sandbox, local workspace, or per-run output owner. | Must declare root, allowed operations, diff summary, artifact manifest, secret scan, timeout, cleanup, and approval gates. |
| `@sandbox-policy` | Source-backed declarative policy for one agent runtime boundary. | Runtime policy source selected by the operator or owning harness. | Carries policy identity and path only; never credential values, implicit approval, compatibility aliases, or an isolation claim. |
| `@message-gateway` | Typed message bus for user, agent, worker, tool, review, and artifact events. | Approved local harness, MCP gateway, or control-plane owner where deployed. | Messages require schema, sender, recipient, run id, state transition, replay rule, and visibility boundary. |
| `@payment-rail` | Registry of provider-backed settlement paths plus the one rail selected for an intent. | Existing payments capability owner and its rail registry source. | Names rail identifiers, supported currencies, and supported settlement assets only; never a credential, and never a second payment routing tier. |
| `@payment-intent` | The locally owned record of one requested payment, keyed by a client-generated intent key. | Existing payments capability owner and its intent store. | Carries intent identity, minor-unit amount, currency, settlement asset, selected rail, and state; excludes card numbers, verification values, and full bank account numbers. |
| `@payment-provider` | The server-side trust boundary that holds provider credentials and issues every provider call. | Existing server-side payment runtime and its secret store. | Credentials stay server-side over transport-secured requests only; browser source, bundle output, local storage, and URLs are rejected, and one provider API version is pinned per deployment. |
| `@payment-event` | One inbound provider settlement callback plus its recorded processing identity. | Existing provider event ingress owner and its event ledger. | Authenticity must be verified before the payload is read, and provider state remains the settlement authority over the payload. |
| `@payment-record` | The serialized projection of terminal payment records for local audit and receipts. | Existing payment record serializer and its document store. | Deterministic and byte-stable; excludes credentials, card numbers, bank account numbers, buyer email addresses, and provider customer identifiers. |
| `@payment-readiness` | Per-rail configuration completeness snapshot for the payments capability. | Existing per-rail readiness gate. | Read-only; reports required credential names, presence, pinned version, configured integration model, and terminal sandbox proof without mutating configuration or granting deploy authority. |
| `@coordination-plan` | One immutable set of task ids, declared write sets, dependency ids, priorities, authority states, and digest-bound findings. | Operator-selected external JSON normalized by `scripts/coordination-scheduler-contract.mjs`. | The binding contains no command, secret, lease mutation, approval, or inferred authority; malformed graphs and unscoped global findings fail closed. |
