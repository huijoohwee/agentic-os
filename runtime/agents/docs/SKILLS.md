# Skills

This on-demand contract is owned by `agentic-os` under
[DURABLE-AGENT-WORKFLOWS-001@0.1.0](../../../guides/DURABLE-WORKFLOWS.md).
The [migration record](../MIGRATION-DOCS.json) binds its native source. Runtime and
live-provider observations below retain their original scope; historical proof
links remain pinned to that source. Current package checks run with `npm run check:all`.

The status vocabulary is metadata, with proof required for each assigned status:

```json
["draft", "spec-complete", "runtime-ready", "gated", "blocked"]
```

This document is the metadata-first catalog for Agentic Canvas OS skills. It makes reusable capabilities discoverable without placing every workflow in the default instruction context. It does not execute commands, load providers, authorize mutation, or duplicate runtime registries.

## Progressive Disclosure

1. Discover the catalog metadata and select a skill whose intent matches the task.
2. Load the selected skill contract or specialized owner document.
3. Load referenced resources only when they are required for the current step.
4. Route execution through the existing harness or runtime owner.
5. Surface typed proof, cost, fallback, and deploy state.

Unselected workflow detail stays out of context. Deep reference chains, copied external skill bodies, and speculative bulk loading fail the catalog contract.

## Skill Shape

| Field | Catalog requirement |
|---|---|
| Identity | Stable lowercase dot id and one clear intent. |
| Owner | Existing source, harness, parser, or runtime boundary. |
| Input and output | Typed payloads, errors, proof, and approved mutation target. |
| Bounds | Timeout, iteration or call limit, circuit breaker, and fail-before-spend conditions. |
| Cost | Actual model usage when reported; exact zero for model-free checks. |
| Status | One declared status from the vocabulary above, supported by current evidence. |

The three dictionaries own invocation tokens: `DICTIONARY-COMMAND.md`, `DICTIONARY-SEMANTIC.md`, and `DICTIONARY-BINDING.md`. `HARNESS-CONTRACTS.md` owns shared execution detail, and `RUNTIME-PROOF.md` owns promotion evidence.

## Catalog Families

| Family | Skill ids | Detail owner |
|---|---|---|
| Source and proof | `source.normalize`, `context.resolve`, `harness.define`, `runtime.check`, `instruction.audit`, `instruction.quality.evaluate`, `cost.audit`, `deploy.guard`, `docs.sync`, `repository.pack`, `workspace.artifact.lifecycle` | `FACTS.md`, `HARNESS-CONTRACTS.md`, `INSTRUCTION-AUDIT.md`, `INSTRUCTION-QUALITY-EVALUATION.md`, `REPOSITORY-PACKING.md`, `REPOSITORY-RUNTIME-READINESS.md`, the invocation dictionaries, and `MCP-GATEWAY.md` |
| Identity and memory | `soul.load`, `personality.overlay`, `memory.write`, `memory.compact`, `memory.search`, `session.search`, `user.profile`, `identity.reflect` | `SOUL.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `MEMORY-LOG.md`, `USER.md` |
| Skill and context loading | `skill.discover`, `skill.load`, `skill.bundle`, `skill.manage`, `skill.propose`, `skill.evolve`, `context.discover`, `context.load`, `context.audit`, `reference.expand`, `reference.audit` | This catalog, dictionaries, `SKILL-EVOLUTION.md`, and `HARNESS-CONTRACTS.md` |
| Tools | `tool.catalog`, `tool.route`, `tool.provider.select`, `tool.gateway.audit`, `toolset.enable`, `toolset.disable`, `tool.search`, `tool.describe`, `tool.call` | `MCP-GATEWAY.md` and `HARNESS-CONTRACTS.md` |
| Orchestration | `moa.run`, `experience.capture`, `orchestration.graph`, `agent.team`, `agent.swarm`, `agent.toolkit`, `state.checkpoint`, `human.review`, `stream.trace`, `superagent.run`, `kanban.collaborate` | `AGENT-TEAM.md`, `AGENT-SWARM.md`, `AGENT-TOOLKIT.md`, `HARNESS-CONTRACTS.md`, `huijoohwee/.workspace/.todo/docs/kanban.md`, and runtime-specific proof |
| Agentic graph | `agentic.graph.parser.generate`, `agentic.graph.ingest`, `agentic.graph.query`, `agentic.graph.explain` | `AGENTIC-GRAPH.md`, `MCP-GATEWAY.md`, and the agentic-graph executable owner |
| Canvas and domain capabilities | `launch.copilot`, `flow.computing`, `image.to-threejs`, `image.to-glb`, `voice.studio`, `sme.risk.profile`, `crawler.run`, `url.ingest`, `sandbox.policy.author`, `sandbox.gateway.troubleshoot` | Specialized documents and the named agentic-graph runtime owners |

The `launch.copilot` skill resolves `/launch-copilot` to Graph's existing Chat dispatcher at `/81rv10/`. Its shared `launch-copilot` preset seeds a reference-only outline without executing or calling a model. Import a complete source with Graph Import URL/GitHub import and select its nodes, cluster or edges before Run. Use `outline reference <requirement>` for an editable outline; change to `owned` only for a source you own, or explicitly use `draft` with the authorized Graph model connection. Follow-up `probe`, `refine`, `reopen`, `export`, `review` and `status` take the returned CID; `approve` additionally requires the exact review token. `connect <code>` and `disconnect` reuse the paired host. Arguments and runtime bounds remain owned by [Graph's Launch Copilot guide](https://github.com/huijoohwee/agentic-graph/blob/d003fc2663a5d842c9865a1e6fdceb5063e2368c/docs/launch-copilot.md). MCP dictionary resolution supplies metadata only. Canvas owns the ingest/parse validators; Graph owns the native panels and source-bound Probe-Tree overlay; neither preset selection nor dictionary discovery opens a PR.

## Specialized Contracts

| Capability | Selected detail |
|---|---|
| Instruction audit | `INSTRUCTION-AUDIT.md` |
| Instruction task quality | `INSTRUCTION-QUALITY-EVALUATION.md` |
| Image to Three.js | `IMAGE-TO-THREEJS-SKILL.md` |
| Image to GLB | `IMAGE-TO-GLB-SKILL.md` |
| AI Voice Studio | `VOICE-STUDIO.md` |
| Sandbox policy | `SANDBOX-RUNTIME.md` |
| Agent Team | `AGENT-TEAM.md` |
| Agent Swarm | `AGENT-SWARM.md` |
| Agent Toolkit | `AGENT-TOOLKIT.md` |
| Skill Evolution | `SKILL-EVOLUTION.md` |
| Deterministic agentic graph | `AGENTIC-GRAPH.md` |
| Repository packing | `REPOSITORY-PACKING.md` |
| Workspace artifact lifecycle | Invocation dictionaries and `MCP-GATEWAY.md` |
| Computing flow | `PRD-TAD-ADR-MVP-GTM.md` and the invocation dictionaries |

Variants remain metadata aliases over registered owners: `agent.moa`,
`agent.collaboration-manager`, `agent.evidence-scout`, `agent.risk-reviewer`,
`agent.investment-research`, `agent.sme-care`, `agent.video`, `agent.crawler`,
`agent.docs`, `agent.code`, `agent.cost`, `agent.learning`, and
`agent.orchestrator`. The collaboration variants resolve through the exact
agentic-graph Agent Definition registry and its `/collaboration-manager-agent`,
`/evidence-scout-agent`, and `/risk-reviewer-agent` routes. The other domain
variants resolve through `/investment-research-agent`, `/sme-care-agent`,
`/video-agent`, and `/crawler-agent`; `agent.orchestrator` resolves role-based team requests through `/agent.team`.
A variant does not create a wildcard command or a second execution registry.
The `url.ingest` skill resolves only through the exact four-token invocation `/ingest-url @url:https://example.com @reference-policy #canvas`; `agentic-graph.agentic_canvas_os.docs.invoke` supplies read-only discovery metadata and guarded browser WebMCP tool `agentic-graph.control_local_import_url` remains the sole Import URL executor.
The `agentic.graph.parser.generate` skill resolves only through `/agentic.graph.parser.generate #agentic-graph #parser-generation #mcp @parser-specification @runtime-proof`; dictionary resolution remains read-only, while the exact local agentic-graph MCP tool owns deterministic compilation and returns digest-fenced identity without generated code or implicit ingest.
The `workspace.artifact.lifecycle` skill resolves only through `/workspace.artifact.manage #workspace-artifact-lifecycle @artifact-operation @workspace-entry @artifact-policy @runtime-proof`; add `@operator` only for apply. The skill delegates local execution to the exact plan/apply MCP tools and preserves `/workspace.launch`, `/source.ingest`, and `/file.sync` as the UI, URL-ingest, and provider-sync owners.

## Selection And Mutation

- Select by intent and required capability, not by provider or UI surface.
- Return a typed gap when the selected owner, binding, approval, or proof is absent.
- Keep writes proposal-first when policy requires review; scan and validate approved writes at the owning boundary.
- Route paid, authenticated, mutating, sensitive, Prod, and Cloudflare actions through explicit operator gates.
- Preserve raw unsupported invocation text instead of creating compatibility aliases.

## Runtime Readiness

A catalog entry is spec-complete when its identity, owner, schemas, bounds, cost posture, fallback, and VCC are source-backed. A verified runtime status additionally requires focused executable proof from the shared owner. Catalog presence alone never proves provider availability, live execution, artifact persistence, or deployment.

The shared `agentic-graph.agentic_canvas_os.docs.invoke` projection binds the three invocation dictionaries into one deterministic SHA-256 catalog digest over token, kind, label, summary, and source path. FloatingPanel Skills & Commands may mix local executable behavior with those rows, but source-backed dictionary metadata wins token collisions; hydration is fresh only after exact `/`, `#`, and `@` counts and browser-recomputed digest parity pass.

`instruction.audit` is model-free. It audits `AGENTS.md` and this catalog for required intent, bounded instruction density, duplicate instructions, route-detail load, and canonical-owner leakage. Its typed report contains zero model tokens and no mutation or deployment authority.

`instruction.quality.evaluate` scores provenance-bound final answers against the selected repository suite. The evaluator invokes no model, reads no private reasoning, and requires a complete candidate packet plus human review before any quality promotion.

## External Boundary

External documentation and projects inform capability shape only. This repository does not copy their code, prose, prompts, schemas, examples, tests, fixtures, layouts, packages, or runtime dependencies. Local owners, dictionaries, validation, and proof remain authoritative.

## VCCs

| VCC | Observable check |
|---|---|
| Discovery is light | Frontmatter exposes ids and variants before selected detail loads. |
| Selection is bounded | One selected owner supplies the needed workflow and shallow references. |
| Routes stay canonical | Invocation entries resolve through the three dictionaries. |
| Promotion is honest | Runtime claims link current executable proof and cost state. |
| Default context stays lean | `npm run instruction-audit:check` passes its budgets and duplicate checks. |
| Task quality stays observable | `npm run instruction-quality:check` validates the suite and scorer; a named candidate passes only through explicit final-answer evaluation. |
| Deployment stays closed | Audit and catalog validation make no Prod mirror or Cloudflare mutation. |
