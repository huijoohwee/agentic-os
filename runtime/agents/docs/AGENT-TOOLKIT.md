# Agent Toolkit

This on-demand contract is owned by `agentic-os` under
[DURABLE-AGENT-WORKFLOWS-001@0.1.0](../../../guides/DURABLE-WORKFLOWS.md).
The [migration record](../MIGRATION-DOCS.json) binds its native source. Runtime and
live-provider observations below retain their original scope; historical proof
links remain pinned to that source. Current package checks run with `npm run check:all`.

Agent Toolkit is a native observer, profiler, evaluator, optimizer, and
learning-proposal layer for exact agent and team revisions. Its adapter contract is
framework-neutral: an application can wrap a supported runtime without moving
execution, scheduling, tool policy, or final-answer ownership into the Toolkit.
Compatibility is proven per adapter; this contract does not claim universal
framework compatibility.

## Ownership Boundaries

| Concern | Owner | Toolkit boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Agent or team execution | Existing runtime or injected application adapter | Observes metadata; never becomes the runner. |
| Team topology and scheduling | Agent Orchestration or Agent Swarm | Does not invent roles, tasks, branches, or workflows. |
| Model and tool calls | Running Agents and Function Calling | Accepts one owner-reported aggregate cost; never double-counts nested calls. |
| Authorization | Authenticated session plus application authorizer | Fails before evaluator spend or proposal persistence. |
| Evaluation | Injected evaluator plus digest-bound dataset and metric identities | Missing or failed evidence remains `unreported`; quality is never inferred. |
| Learning | Review-pending proposal record | No apply, prompt rewrite, fine-tuning, registry mutation, promotion, or deploy method exists. |

## Exact Adapter Contract

Every run fixes these identities before observation:

- `target`: `agent` or `team`, exact id, revision, and SHA-256 digest;
- `candidate`: exact id, revision, and SHA-256 digest;
- `adapter`: exact id, revision, and SHA-256 digest;
- `profile`: evaluator, dataset, and metric ids, revisions, and SHA-256 digests
  plus `maximize` or `minimize` direction;
- `runId`, `cohortId`, and a bounded operation name.

Those identities are caller-declared and consistency-checked, not looked up in
an internal or external revision registry. An application authorizer must
verify each digest against its trusted source before treating provenance as
verified; the default readiness state is `application-authorizer-required` and
revision provenance otherwise remains `unverified`.

The local `instrument(request, operation, access)` wrapper passes a server-owned
`AbortSignal`, returns the adapter value to its caller, and persists no value or
input. Direct lifecycle methods let an authenticated integration start and
finish metadata spans around work that remains owned elsewhere.

## Lifecycle

| Method or route | Effect | Terminal evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `start` / `POST /api/agent-toolkit/start` | Authorize and reserve one run plus an exact cohort. | Session-owned running record or typed block. |
| `startSpan` / `start-span` | Server-time one bounded nested component span. | Id, parent, kind, operation, component revision, and start time only. |
| `finishSpan` / `finish-span` | Finish an open span using server time. | Status, stable reason code, and observed duration. |
| `complete` / `complete` | Seal the run and append one idempotent cohort sample. | Run duration, status, and one aggregate cost state. |
| `evaluate` / `evaluate` | Reserve a fenced attempt, call the injected evaluator outside durable claims, then commit digest-bound provenance. | Reported score and unique evidence reference, or honest unreported state. |
| `compare` / `compare` | Compare exact baseline and candidate identities inside one cohort. | Deterministic policy checks and `propose` or `hold`. |
| `propose` / `propose` | Persist an evidence-digest-bound proposal. | Immutable `review_pending`, `reviewRequired: true`, `applied: false`. |
| `status` / `status` | Read one sanitized run owned by the session principal. | Metadata-only run, spans, cost, and evaluation state. |
| `profile` / `POST /api/agent-toolkit/profile` | Profile one owned run without reading its payload. | Span p50/p95/p99/max latency, status counts, five bounded bottlenecks, aggregate token usage, and cost. |
| `optimize` / `POST /api/agent-toolkit/optimize` | Rank up to sixteen exact evaluated candidates. | Deterministic quality-first, latency, cost, and digest ordering; recommendation only. |

HTTP accepts no caller-owned signal. `instrument` is a library method rather
than a remote execution route, so arbitrary framework payloads and callbacks do
not cross the Worker API.

## Metadata-Only Observability

Stored spans contain component identity, parent relation, operation, timestamps,
duration, status, and a stable reason code. Run evidence contains exact revision
metadata, aggregate cost state, metric provenance, score when reported, and
opaque evidence ids and digests.

The Toolkit does not store prompts, inputs, outputs, tool arguments or results,
headers, secrets, private reasoning, exception messages, or provider state. An
optional injected exporter receives only schema, action, status, stable reason,
principal and identity digests, trust label, timestamp, and server duration.
Exporter failure never changes the operation result. The Worker enables
structured platform logs explicitly through `AGENT_TOOLKIT_TELEMETRY_ENABLED`;
the library performs no default network egress and owns no external backend.
Opaque identifiers use a conservative bounded machine-token grammar, but no
grammar can determine whether a token is sensitive; the application authorizer
must reject secret-bearing identifiers before admission.

Session authentication proves ownership, not telemetry truth. Locally wrapped
server timing is `server-observed`; direct library lifecycle calls are
`application-verified` only at an application-owned trusted boundary. HTTP
lifecycle submissions are always `remote-unverified`, stay visible as such,
and are excluded from comparison and proposal evidence. Digest binding,
application authorization, unique evidence, minimum samples, and same-cohort
rules reduce but cannot eliminate poisoning risk.

## Evaluation And Recommendation

Evaluator work happens after a durable attempt reservation and outside every
Durable Object claim. The evaluator adapter must honor the server-owned
`AbortSignal` and stable idempotency key; timeout or abort leaves an attempt
in-doubt until its lease expires, and any retry reuses that key. Commit requires
the live reservation fence and the metric id, revision, digest, and direction
fixed at run admission. An expired or stale attempt cannot overwrite a newer
result, and one evidence digest cannot satisfy multiple cohort samples.

Comparison uses successful trusted samples for one cohort bound to target,
adapter, operation, profile, and candidate digests. It requires the declared
minimum sample count plus reported quality and cost for both sides, and reports
trusted and excluded-untrusted counts. Arithmetic means feed four explicit
checks:

1. candidate quality meets the direction-aware boundary;
2. candidate quality improvement meets the declared minimum;
3. observed latency regression stays within its ratio;
4. reported aggregate cost regression stays within its ratio.

Missing quality, missing cost, reused evidence, remote-unverified telemetry,
cross-cohort evidence, zero-denominator regressions, or too few trusted samples
produce `hold` or `insufficient-evidence`, never an invented improvement. A
passing comparison is still correlation within the declared cohort, not a
general causal claim. Comparison reads already committed evidence and does not
require a configured evaluator; only new evaluation work does.

`profile` reports distribution and bottleneck evidence for one exact run.
`optimize` evaluates already-committed comparisons for a bounded set of exact
candidates, filters to candidates that pass every quality, latency, and cost
gate, then orders them by quality improvement, latency ratio, cost ratio, and
candidate digest. It performs no parameter search, prompt mutation, model call,
training, or application.

## Continuous Learning

Continuous learning is the bounded sequence `evidence -> evaluation ->
comparison -> optimization recommendation -> review-pending proposal`. The
recommendation chooses only among exact pre-evaluated candidates. The proposal
binds exact baseline and candidate revisions to the comparison digest and is
idempotent by operation id. An external reviewer may use that record in its own
authorized workflow. The Toolkit cannot approve or apply it.

## Durability, Bounds, And Recovery

`AGENT_STATE` stores one coordination atom per run and one per cohort. Claims are
short and never cover adapter or evaluator I/O. Its Durable Object adapter
schedules an alarm at the nearest claim or record expiry: the alarm recovers a
live record from an expired claim or physically deletes an expired atom, then
reschedules the next boundary. The in-memory fallback preserves the atomic
interface with logical expiry only and reports no horizontal recovery. Current
defaults:

| Bound | Default |
|---|---:|
| Run retention and fixed deadline | 30 minutes |
| Cohort rolling retention | 7 days |
| Spans per run | 128 |
| Samples per cohort | 64 |
| Proposals per cohort | 16 |
| Optimization candidates | 16 |
| Evaluator attempts | 2 |
| Adapter or evaluator call timeout | 60 seconds |
| Serialized record ceiling | 300,000 characters |
| Requests per principal per 60-second window | 240 |
| Retained runs per principal | 32 |
| Retained cohorts per principal | 8 |
| Principal admission shards | 64 |
| Retained principals per shard | 64 |

Run and cohort keys are derived from the authenticated principal, so foreign
principals receive no existence disclosure. The authenticated session must
cover the fixed run deadline. A refreshed token that creates a new session
principal cannot resume the old namespace; longer-lived cohorts require a
stable, tenant-scoped application principal established by the application
authorizer. Cohort samples are bounded; older entries leave the rolling window
instead of creating unbounded Durable Object hotspots.

One of 64 bounded admission shards reserves each principal before any
principal-owned object is created. One atomic admission record per admitted
principal then enforces the request window plus run and cohort cardinality
before lifecycle state is read or created. These records store only identity
digests and expiries. With the `AGENT_STATE` Durable Object store, admission is
horizontally consistent and recovers across isolates; the memory fallback
remains suitable only for single-process development.

## Clean-Room Boundary

The NVIDIA materials in frontmatter inform only the broad capability class:
framework-neutral instrumentation, profiling, evaluation, and optimization.
This implementation was authored against existing repository contracts. It
must not copy or depend on external code, prose, prompts, schemas, CLIs, APIs,
configuration, examples, tests, fixtures, assets, defaults, algorithms,
packages, services, model endpoints, or runtime names.

## Verification

```sh
npm run agent-toolkit:check
npm test
npm run web:build
npm run docs:check
```

VCC: two runtime instances share atomic state, only one evaluator reservation
spends, per-principal admission is atomic, server-owned timing survives without
raw payload retention, profiling and structured telemetry expose metadata only,
digest-bound cohorts reject untrusted or insufficient evidence, deterministic
optimization produces only a review-gated recommendation, supported evidence
produces only a review-pending proposal, readiness stays sanitized, and no
external package or default egress is added.
