# Sandbox Agents Runtime

This on-demand contract is owned by `agentic-os` under
[DURABLE-AGENT-WORKFLOWS-001@0.1.0](../../../guides/DURABLE-WORKFLOWS.md).
The [migration record](../MIGRATION-DOCS.json) binds its native source. Runtime and
live-provider observations below retain their original scope; historical proof
links remain pinned to that source. Current package checks run with `npm run check:all`.

The runtime gives an application-owned agent controller a bounded way to use a container workspace. Agentic Canvas OS owns lifecycle, capability, approval, identity, redaction, limits, cost, and public evidence. An injected provider owns the actual container, filesystem, processes, package tooling, port forwarding, snapshots, and provider session state.

The cited OpenAI guides inform only the capability class and the value of separating orchestration from compute. This repository uses independently authored names, data shapes, limits, tests, and prose. It imports no provider SDK, sandbox client, sample, manifest, schema, prompt, model default, fixture, or runtime dependency.

## Ownership Boundary

| Owner | Responsibility | Boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Sandbox Agents controller | Validate one workspace source, requested capabilities, operation inputs, application approval, lifecycle identity, public output, limits, and cost evidence. | It never starts a host process, interprets shell strings, stores credentials, exposes provider state, or claims kernel containment. |
| Injected container provider | Create, operate, snapshot, suspend, resume, and close the actual isolated workspace. | Its declaration and per-operation attestation are evidence claims, not independent containment verification. |
| Application authorizer | Approve each workspace and operation using current policy, actor, agent, run, path, command, package, and port context. | Agent instructions and provider metadata cannot grant approval. |
| External state store | Persist opaque snapshot references and serialized resume state across controller lifetimes. | The default Worker does not install an implicit in-memory durability substitute. |
| Podman CLI adapter | Run an immutable image as a non-root, read-only, capability-dropped, resource-bounded container; use an internal network plus hardened loopback proxy for declared previews. | Node-only and explicitly injected; it rejects image tags, environment bindings, public ports, online packages, and host bind mounts. |
| Independent Podman verifier | Inspect engine, container, network, and preview-proxy configuration and run non-root, root-write, workspace-write, and egress-denial probes. | Verifies one local Podman boundary at run time; it is not formal third-party, cloud, or multi-tenant certification. |
| Native sandbox policy preflight | Continue to validate and authorize agentic-graph filesystem, process, network, and credential policy before execution. | `SANDBOX-RUNTIME.md` remains policy preflight only; this controller does not turn it into kernel enforcement. |

## Container Provider Contract

One adapter revision declares the exact subset of `files`, `commands`, `packages`, `ports`, `snapshots`, and `resume` that it can provide. The runtime accepts only an adapter that declares a `container` execution boundary and implements create, execute, snapshot, suspend, resume, and close operations.

Every successful provider result must freshly attest:

- the registered provider id and exact revision;
- a container execution boundary;
- the capabilities used by that operation; and
- a reported, unreported, or not-run cost state.

Missing, stale, mismatched, incomplete, or non-container attestation blocks the result. `provider-attested` never means independently verified. A deployment may promote containment only after separate provider and host evidence proves the boundary.

## Workspace Sources

A sandbox starts from exactly one source:

| Source | Input | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Fresh workspace | Revision, bounded directories, bounded text files, named host environment bindings, and declared preview ports. | Paths are normalized workspace-relative paths. The Podman adapter rejects environment bindings so their values cannot enter container metadata or snapshots. |
| Saved snapshot | One opaque application token resolved through the external state store. | Agent identity and provider revision must match; a fresh workspace cannot be mixed into the same open request. |

The provider snapshot id stays inside the state store and provider call. Callers receive only a controller-issued snapshot token plus bounded, secret-scanned metadata.

## Operations

| Capability | Operation | Guard |
|---|---|---|
| Files | Read or write one normalized relative path. | Absolute paths, traversal, duplicate workspace entries, oversized content, and sensitive provider output fail closed. |
| Commands | Run one argument vector with an optional relative working directory and explicit foreground or background mode. | Shell command strings are not accepted; arguments and execution time are bounded. |
| Packages | Install a bounded, explicit package list with a named manager. | The Podman adapter accepts only approved workspace-local npm packages with offline mode and lifecycle scripts disabled. |
| Ports | Open one predeclared container port for private or preview access. | A hardened proxy binds an ephemeral host port to `127.0.0.1`; the agent container stays only on an internal network and public audience is unsupported. |

Only one operation may be active per sandbox. Competing operations return `sandbox_busy`; they are not queued or replayed. Each successful operation increments a bounded sequence and may update opaque provider state without returning that state to the caller.

## State And Resume

Keep three state surfaces distinct:

| Surface | Purpose | Persistence |
|---|---|---|
| Active session | Current provider session id and bounded opaque state for one live sandbox. | Controller-local and never public. |
| Resume checkpoint | Serialized provider state bound to sandbox, run, agent, workspace revision, capabilities, and provider revision. | Atomic file-backed claim; one controller consumes or releases the exact checkpoint across process lifetimes. |
| Workspace snapshot | Provider-owned saved files and artifacts that can seed a new sandbox run. | External state store holds only the opaque provider reference and binding metadata. |

Pause serializes resume state, closes the live provider session, then atomically persists the checkpoint. Resume can occur in a new controller instance using the same external store and provider revision. A wrong run, agent, provider, or revision releases rather than consumes the claimed checkpoint.

Snapshots seed new work. Resume continues the same sandbox identity. Neither surface replaces Running Agents conversation state, prompt history, model continuation, or application checkpoints.

## Security And Secrets

- Workspace environment entries name host bindings; they never contain values.
- The application authorizer is mandatory for open, file, command, package, port, snapshot, pause, and resume actions.
- Public provider output is JSON-only, bounded, and rejected when a field name indicates credentials, authorization, secrets, tokens, passwords, API keys, or opaque state.
- Unexpected provider exceptions become a generic typed failure; raw provider messages are not returned.
- Close is always available as lifecycle cleanup and does not require an additional approval grant.
- Podman snapshots archive only `/workspace` into a private bounded provider directory; processes, root filesystem state, environment bindings, and host paths are excluded.
- Prod mirror, Cloudflare deployment, public ports, and paid execution remain outside this contract unless separately authorized.

## Default Bounds

| Bound | Default |
|---|---:|
| Active sandboxes | 32 |
| Operations per sandbox | 256 |
| Workspace entries per category | 256 |
| Workspace contract | 500,000 characters |
| One file | 200,000 characters |
| Command arguments | 64 |
| One argument | 4,096 characters |
| Packages per install | 64 |
| Public provider output | 200,000 characters |
| Opaque or serialized state | 500,000 characters |
| Provider operation time | 30,000 milliseconds |

Limits are explicit positive integers. Capacity is fail-closed; no sandbox, operation, snapshot, or checkpoint is silently evicted.

## Readiness Contract

`GET /api/ready` exposes sanitized controller policy, configured dependencies, provider identity and capabilities when registered, counters, limits, and two separate proof states:

- `containerExecutionStatus` is `unverified` until an injected provider returns accepted fresh attestation, then `provider-attested`;
- `independentContainmentProof` becomes `verified` only when the separate verifier returns fresh all-pass checks for that concrete provider session.

The default Worker constructs an isolate-scoped unconfigured controller. Therefore `contractReady` is true while `configured`, `containmentVerifierConfigured`, and `liveContainerReady` are false. A Node host must inject all four concrete owners; readiness inspection never starts Podman.

## Acceptance Contract

- Given a complete provider, authorizer, and state store, a fresh workspace can perform bounded file, command, package, and preview-port operations through one serialized controller.
- Given a snapshot, a new sandbox receives only the provider snapshot reference after exact agent and provider-revision checks.
- Given a pause, a second controller instance can resume the same sandbox through one exact external checkpoint without exposing serialized state.
- Given missing capability, approval, dependency, identity, revision, attestation, containment claim, safe path, safe port audience, bound, or public-output safety, the operation blocks before a success claim.
- Given the live Podman command, one immutable image must prove real container execution, offline local package installation, loopback preview traffic, snapshot seeding, cross-controller resume, 21 independent checks, zero reported spend, and no remaining labeled container or network.

VCC: run `npm run sandbox-provider:check`, the affected app and Worker tests, and `AGENTIC_SANDBOX_IMAGE=<immutable-digest> npm run sandbox-podman:check`; require zero failures, exact provider fencing, application approval, atomic resume claims, 21 fresh containment checks, opaque state, complete cleanup, zero paid cost, no copied artifacts, no Prod mirror mutation, and no Cloudflare action.
