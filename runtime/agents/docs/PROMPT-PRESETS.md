Keep one CID, RAO and SVO chain, five native document panels and a separate proposed-work overlay. Reuse existing owners and contracts; distinguish evidence from assumptions. Do not infer code ownership, payment readiness, model verification or production readiness from this reference. Keep publication behind exact-content review and approval.

      Rebuild the selected or attached PNG, JPG, JPEG, or SVG reference as code-only procedural Three.js without mutating the source Widget Card or input media. Use the universal connected-silhouette contour-volume lane: preserve disconnected negative spaces, quantize a compact plan, and reject object-specific templates, horizontal box bands, baked geometry, serialized geometry, data URIs, loaders, network calls, and external modules. Enforce bounded component, outline, material, triangle, source, and three-pass review/correction budgets. Keep geometry, PBR material, reference, and action gates separate; record the visible front as observed and every rear, interior, or occluded surface as inferred with bounded confidence. Create stable rigid-part pivots and attachment sockets plus one four-second loop-continuous inspection clip bounded to +/-12 degrees yaw; do not claim skinning, morph targets, or deformable readiness. Export the same admitted scene as a full GLB and editable glTF JSON with an external .bin buffer. Use `validated` for deterministic evidence; use `approved` only for a proven optional independent provider review. Treat https://github.com/hoainho/img2threejs and https://github.com/microsoft/TRELLIS.2 as conceptual inspiration only; copy or depend on none of their code, prompts, schemas, examples, tests, fixtures, prose, assets, weights, models, packages, configuration, services, layout, or runtime. Keep the result Dev-only until explicit operator release authority.

      /agentic-graph.probe-tree

      Generate 2-4 bounded, editable next-question cards from this Widget Card under the semantic clarification contract in PROBE-TREE.md. Derive every question and every 2-4 answer choice from the selected user input, give every card a different user-named focus, and attach 2-6 short context anchors copied verbatim from that input. Every answer choice must express a decision-relevant preference, tradeoff, or consequence rather than a mechanical number, range, unit, named entity, or topic fragment. Never reuse a choice label, one card's complete choice set, or a subset/superset of it in another card. For a continuation, the selected child and its committed Output own the next topic; the root is lineage only. Classify the action-topic families RECOMMEND, COMPARE, ASSESS, and PLAN semantically and case-insensitively as clarification requests; an imperative or action verb never establishes terminal intent. Only a runtime-recognized selected-child terminal continuation bypasses card generation. Never substitute stock evidence, policy, reviewer, approval, system-of-record, recalled-exemplar, or fixture content unless the user actually named it. Keep the source card unchanged, connect each candidate branch, and atomically connect the source to its single owned Probe-Tree Branches Rich Media ledger. Preserve user-authored output targets; for a runtime-recognized selected-child terminal continuation, atomically create or reuse one owned Generated Result Rich Media Panel and one typed output edge from that child without merging targets or attaching an unrelated panel. Stop visibly at depth 8. Widget Run authorizes the bounded MCP context call followed by the active Chat provider, endpoint, and model. Never use stale card-local routing or materialize query-specific hardcoding or zero-model fallback cards; fail closed when fewer than two semantic cards survive.

      Assess the active SME workspace sources across cyber, supply-chain, physical-asset, and growth-stage exposure. Keep exposure, current coverage, apparent gaps, unknown risks, evidence confidence, and urgency distinct. Produce provider-neutral protection guidance, evidence-needed fields, rationale, and a review-ready licensed-adviser handoff. Stop before quote, bind, purchase, contact, paid-provider, persistence, Prod, or Cloudflare actions unless each required approval and capability is available. Never treat unknown coverage as safe.

      Analyze the investment question using the active workspace sources. Separate claims, evidence, assumptions, contradictions, open questions, freshness, and verification steps; mark unsupported material claims as unknown. Produce a concise research brief, evidence ledger, contradiction ledger, risk/catalyst view, and review-first graph candidates. This is research support, not financial advice. Stop before paid-provider, graph mutation, persistence, transaction, Prod, or Cloudflare actions unless each required approval and capability is available.

      Crawl the referenced website with the native headless browser automation runtime. Reuse the Import URL pipeline, download supported website files, persist the crawl report and Markdown pipe-table artifacts, and project the result into Canvas. Keep the input prompt unchanged; create separate connected Rich Media Panel outputs for the report and multi-dimensional table. Report processed pages, successful pages, errors, and stored files.

      Assess the SME's material exposures using only the active request and workspace sources. If sector, operating footprint, assets, current coverage, or decision horizon is missing and would change the assessment, ask one focused clarification before concluding. Separate observed exposure, inferred exposure, existing protection, gaps, unknowns, evidence confidence, and urgency.

      /sme-care-agent @source.frontmatter @source.body @local-harness @cost-log @runtime-proof #frontmatter #harness #token-economics #runtime-ready #approval-gate

      Compare the user-named SME protection choices against the decision variables present in the active request and workspace sources. Ask a focused clarification when a missing priority, exposure, limit, or tradeoff would change the comparison. Distinguish coverage relevance, exclusions or unknowns, operational fit, evidence confidence, and adviser-review needs. Do not fabricate product terms, rankings, premiums, providers, or a recommendation unsupported by the supplied context.

      Compare only the investment options named by the user or supported by active workspace sources. If objective, horizon, liquidity need, downside tolerance, jurisdiction, or comparison basis is missing and material, ask one focused clarification. Separate evidence, assumptions, contradictions, risk drivers, potential catalysts, liquidity, and verification gaps.

      Assess the proposed investment plan against the user-named objective, constraints, evidence, and review horizon. Ask one focused clarification when a missing constraint or decision variable would materially change the assessment. Separate supported strengths, unsupported assumptions, concentration or liquidity risks, contradictions, monitoring triggers, and verification steps. Do not invent portfolio facts, expected returns, market data, transactions, or personalized financial advice.

# Prompt Presets

This on-demand contract is owned by `agentic-os` under
[DURABLE-AGENT-WORKFLOWS-001@0.1.0](../../../guides/DURABLE-WORKFLOWS.md).
The [migration record](../MIGRATION-DOCS.json) binds its native source. Runtime and
live-provider observations below retain their original scope; historical proof
links remain pinned to that source. Current package checks run with `npm run check:all`.

Launch Copilot r3 is an on-demand native Graph composition action. Its shared
prompt, five-role source joins, claim validator and document serializer live in
[Graph’s native contract](https://github.com/huijoohwee/agentic-graph/blob/c5527b6f80ecbd6b8d1340ccda99e5f3f9e1473f/mcp/agent-graph/launch-copilot-contract.js); consumers load that owner without copying it
into a preset or adding a provider route. Graph retains import/parse, selection,
Chat, canvas and workspace persistence. An editable outline is explicitly not
AI drafting. Validation proves source membership only; human review and OS
publication authority remain separate. No standalone Launch Copilot runtime is
admitted. Native consumer and live-provider proof are required before readiness.

This document is the single prompt-text owner for the agentic-graph FloatingPanel **Prompt Presets** catalog. The runtime reads `prompt_presets` from frontmatter and projects the selected prompt into the existing shared composer.

Selection and loading are zero-spend. **Send** remains the Chat execution boundary. An `llm-chat-response` preset must use the active Chat provider, endpoint, and model; it cannot inherit stale card-local routing. A `native-chat-response` preset resolves through its named shared runtime without inventing a model route. The image-to-threejs, image-to-glb, and Probe-Tree presets may also be inserted from the shared Skills & Commands catalog into the selected Widget Card, where each expands to its canonical `/`, `@`, and `#` tokens without replacing attached source media. The Widget Card **Run** action is the execution boundary for those card-inline presets. The video preset additionally activates its authored Canvas document and source script through the existing source-backed video path; each changed multi-card stage is tracked by the shared active-source GitGraph owner as `Chat Run All i/n: <card>`, while an identical already-published graph remains an accepted no-op. SME Care and Investment Research presets use the shared slash-agent response contracts; Crawler Agent uses the native Import URL workflow.

Every `slash_command` is a catalog-owned selection alias matching `/*-prompt-preset`, except the two native image routes that intentionally reuse their executable slash commands. Every `runtime_command` remains the executable route owned by `SKILLS.md` and the command dictionary. Selecting a preset resolves its `runtime_command` and loads the source-backed prompt without submitting, persisting a chat turn, or rewriting the alias into another catalog entry. `mcp-invocation` calls `agentic-graph.agentic_canvas_os.docs.invoke` with `mcp_token` to resolve the same command metadata; that read-only resolution is not command execution, a model call, or approval to spend or mutate.

## Catalog contract

| Preset | Preset invocation | Runtime route | Load behavior | Send behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Physics Playground | `/xr-physics-prompt-preset` | `/xr.physics` | Load the native controller invocation; Home previews the existing source-authored XR world. Demo opens the corresponding demo document and example Chat thread. | Native physics execution remains owned by the existing XR controller runtime. |
| Video Agent | `/video-prompt-preset` | `/video-agent` | Load the centralized prompt after validating the authored video Canvas and script source. | Activate the committed Canvas and hand it to the shared Run all owner. |
| Image to Three.js | `/image.to-threejs` | `/image.to-threejs @image-to-threejs #image-to-threejs` | Load the native prompt in Chat or insert its three invocation tokens into the selected Widget Card. | Resolve only an attached or selected supported image through the native zero-cost conversion owner. |
| Image to GLB | `/image.to-glb` | `/image.to-glb @image-to-glb #image-to-glb` | Load the native procedural prompt in Chat or insert its three invocation tokens into the selected Widget Card. | Require the compact connected-contour plan, separate geometry/material/reference/action gates, rigid pivots/sockets, bounded inspection loop, full GLB plus editable external-buffer glTF, and honest `validated`/optional `approved` evidence; source media stays unchanged and deploy remains Dev-only. |
| agentic-graph Probe-Tree | `/agentic-graph-probe-tree-prompt-preset` | `/agentic-graph.probe-tree` | Load the source-backed prompt in Chat or insert its slash invocation into the selected Widget Card. The `@` and `#` aliases remain independently authorable. | Classify RECOMMEND, COMPARE, ASSESS, and PLAN action topics semantically and case-insensitively as clarification requests. Use the active Chat provider, endpoint, and model to materialize 2-4 Type 2 child cards with distinct selected-child focuses, context-relevant clarification suggestions, 2-6 verbatim child-or-lineage anchors, Other, and a separate Rich Media branch ledger; only a runtime-recognized selected-child terminal continuation bypasses generation. Reject query-specific hardcoding, inferred output edges, and zero-model fallback cards. |
| SME Care Agent | `/sme-care-prompt-preset` | `/sme-care-agent` | Load the centralized prompt into Chat. | Use the shared slash-agent contract and deterministic SME kernel when that runtime is invoked. |
| Investment Research Agent | `/investment-research-prompt-preset` | `/investment-research-agent` | Load the centralized prompt into Chat. | Use the shared slash-agent contract with source, evidence, review, and cost boundaries. |
| Crawler Agent | `/crawler-prompt-preset` | `/crawler-agent` | Load the centralized prompt into Chat with an editable URL. | Use the native headless Import URL workflow and persist separate report and pipe-table Canvas outputs. |
| SME Risk Assessment | `/sme-risk-assessment-prompt-preset` | `/sme-care-agent` | Load a source-backed assessment prompt and preserve missing decision variables as clarifications. | Use the active Chat tuple; resolve route metadata through the named MCP docs tool when invoked from MCP. |
| SME Protection Comparison | `/sme-protection-comparison-prompt-preset` | `/sme-care-agent` | Load a semantic comparison prompt over user-named choices and sources. | Use the active Chat tuple; do not fabricate products, terms, providers, or premiums. |
| Investment Options Comparison | `/investment-options-comparison-prompt-preset` | `/investment-research-agent` | Load a source-grounded comparison prompt over user-named options. | Use the active Chat tuple; keep unknown facts and financial-advice boundaries explicit. |
| Investment Plan Assessment | `/investment-plan-assessment-prompt-preset` | `/investment-research-agent` | Load a review-first plan assessment prompt. | Use the active Chat tuple; clarify material missing constraints before conclusions. |

Missing invocation modes, duplicate ids, unknown runtime or MCP tokens, a mismatched MCP tool, absent source bindings, unavailable active Chat routing, or an unavailable centralized document fail closed with a visible error. Query-specific hardcoding, zero-model LLM fallback responses, and downstream prompt copies are forbidden.
